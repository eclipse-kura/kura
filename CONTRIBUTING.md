# How to contribute to Eclipse Kura

First of all, thanks for considering to contribute to Eclipse Kura. We really appreciate the time and effort you want to
spend helping to improve things around here. And help we can use :-)

Here is a (non-exclusive, non-prioritized) list of things you might be able to help us with:

* bug reports
* bug fixes
* improvements regarding code quality e.g. improving readability, performance, modularity etc.
* documentation (Getting Started guide, Examples, Deployment instructions ni cloud environments)
* features (both ideas and code are welcome)
* tests

In order to get you started as fast as possible we need to go through some organizational issues first.

## Legal Requirements

Kura is an [Eclipse IoT](http://iot.eclipse.org) project and as such is governed by the Eclipse Development process.
This process helps us in creating great open source software within a safe legal framework.

### First Steps
For you as a contributor, the following preliminary steps are required in order for us to be able to accept your contribution:

* Sign the [Eclipse Foundation Contributor License Agreement](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/CLA.php).
In order to do so:

  * Obtain an Eclipse Foundation user ID. Anyone who currently uses Eclipse Bugzilla or Gerrit systems already has one of those.
If you don't already have an account simply [register on the Eclipse web site](https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/createaccount.php).
  * Once you have your account, log in to the [projects portal](https://projects.eclipse.org/), select *My Account* and then the *Contributor License Agreement* tab.

* Add your GiHub username to your Eclipse Foundation account. Log in to Eclipse and go to [Edit my account](https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php).

### File Headers
A proper header must be in place for any file contributed to Eclipse Kura. For a new contribution, please add the below header:

```
/*******************************************************************************
 * Copyright (c) <year> <legal entity> and others
 *
 * This program and the accompanying materials are made
 * available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License 2.0
 * which accompanies this distribution, and is available at

 *
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: EPL-2.0

 *******************************************************************************/
 ```

 Please ensure \<year\> is replaced with the current year or range (e.g. 2017 or 2015, 2017).
 Please ensure \<legal entity\> is replaced with the relevant information. If you are editing an existing contribution, feel free
 to create or add your legal entity to the contributors section

### How to Contribute
The easiest way to contribute code/patches/whatever is by creating a GitHub pull request (PR). When you do make sure that you *Sign-off* your commit records using the same email address used for your Eclipse account.

You do this by adding the `-s` flag when you make the commit(s), e.g.

    $> git commit -s -m "Shave the yak some more"

You can find all the details in the [Contributing via Git](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git) document on the Eclipse web site.

## Making your Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Create a new branch for your changes
* Configure your IDE installing:
  * The formatter profile available in kura/setup/formatting/KuraFormatter*.xml
  * The cleanup profile available in kura/setup/formatting/KuraCleanupProfile*.xml
  * [SonarLint](http://www.sonarlint.org/eclipse/index.html)
* Make your changes
* Make sure you include test cases for non-trivial features
* Make sure the test suite passes after your changes
* Make sure copyright headers are included in (all) files including updated year(s)
* Make sure build plugins and dependencies and their versions have (approved) CQs
* Make sure proper headers are in place for each file (see above Legal Requirements)
* Commit your changes into that branch
* Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages
* If you have a lot of commits squash them into a single commit
* Make sure you use the `-s` flag when committing as explained above
* Push your changes to your branch in your forked repository
* Make a full clean build (locally and/or using [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org)) before you submit a pull request

## Submitting the Changes

Submit a pull request via the normal GitHub UI.

## After Submitting

* Do not use your branch for any other development, otherwise further changes that you make will be visible in the PR.
