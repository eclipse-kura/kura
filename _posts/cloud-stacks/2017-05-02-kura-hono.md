Eclipse Honoâ„¢ provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol. More information can be found <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/hono/" about="_blank">here</a>. This document outlines how to connect to Eclipse Hono using the Kura Gateway Administrative Console.


## Using the Kura Gateway Administrative Console

The Kura Gateway Administrative Console exposes all services necessary for connecting to Eclipse Hono.
First of all, in the **Cloud Connections** section, a new Hono-enabled connection needs to be setup.

From the Cloud Connections section,

the user needs to create a new connection:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hono/newCloudConnection1.png)

by specifying a valid PID:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hono/newCloudConnection2.png)

The result should be like the one depicted in the following image:

The reference links listed below outline each service involved in the cloud connection. It is recommended that each section be reviewed.

- [CloudService]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud-api/5-stack-components.html#cloudservice)

- [DataService]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud-api/5-stack-components.html#dataservice)

- [MqttDataTransport]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud-api/5-stack-components.html#mqttdatatransport)

### CloudService

The default settings for the CloudService are typically adequate for connecting to a Hono instance. The screen capture shown below displays the default settings for the CloudService. For details about each setting, please refer to [CloudService]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud-api/5-stack-components.html#cloudservice).

### DataService

The majority of default settings in the DataService can be left unchanged. A screen capture of the DataService configuration is shown below. For complete details about the DataService configuration parameters, please refer to [DataService]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud-api/5-stack-components.html#dataservice).

In order for Kura to connect to Eclipse Hono on startup, the *connect.auto-on-startup* option must be set to *true.* If this value is changed from false to true, Kura will immediately begin the connection process. It is recommended that the CloudService and MqttDataTransport are configured before setting the *connect.auto-on-startup* option to true.

{% include alerts.html message='Changing the value of *connect.auto-on-startup* from true to false **will not** disconnect the client from the broker. This setting simply implies that Kura will not automatically connect on the next start of Kura.' %}

### MqttDataTransport

While the majority of default settings in the MqttDataTransport can be left unchanged, the following parameters must be modified:

- **broker-url** - defines the MQTT broker URL related to the target Eclipse Hono instance.

- **topic.context.account-name** - defines the account name of the account to which the device is attempting to connect.

- **username** - identifies the user to be used when creating the connection.

For complete details about the MqttDataTransport configuration parameters, please refer to [MqttDataTransport]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud-api/5-stack-components.html#mqttdatatransport).

## Connect/Disconnect

The status panel can be used to manually connect or disconnect the client while Kura is running. The main button toolbar has a connect and disconnect button that may be used to control connectivity.

{% include alerts.html message='Connecting or disconnecting the client via the status panel has no impact on Kura automatically connecting at startup. This capability is only controlled via the *connect.auto-on-startup* DataService setting.' %}
