As described in the Network Configuration section, Ethernet interfaces have two configuration tabs: **TCP/IP** and **DHCP & NAT**. Each Ethernet interface may be configured either as LAN or WAN; it may also be disabled.

If the interface is designated as LAN and is manually configured, the **DHCP & NAT** tab is enabled to allow DHCP sever and/or 'many-to-one' NAT setup; otherwise, the **DHCP & NAT** tab is disabled.  

For more information on **TCP/IP** and **DHCP & NAT** settings, please refer to the [Network Configuration](network-configuration.html) section.
