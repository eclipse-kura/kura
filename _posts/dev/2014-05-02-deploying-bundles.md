## Overview

This section provides a simple example of how to test and deploy OSGi
bundles and deployment packages in a Kura environment. These
instructions use the “Hello World” OSGi project created in the [previous
section](hello-example.html). In this example, you will learn how to perform
the following functions:

* Use local OSGi emulation mode in Eclipse

* Deploy a bundle to a remote target running the OSGi Framework

* Install a Deployment Package to a remote target running the OSGi Framework

* Manage OSGi bundles on a target device

* Set bundle Logger levels in Kura

### Prerequisites

* [Setting up Kura Development Environment](kura-setup.html)

* [Hello World Using the Kura Logger](hello-example.html)

## Testing the OSGi Plug-in

Once you have created an OSGi plug-in, you can test it in [Local
Emulation Mode](#local-emulation-mode) and/or deploy it to a [Remote
Target Device](#remote-target-device).

### Local Emulation Mode

The Kura user workspace can be used in Eclipse in local emulation mode
(Linux/OS X only; this feature is not currently supported under
Windows). To deploy the code to a running system, see the section
[Remote Target Device](#remote-target-device).

#### Run Kura in Emulator Mode

In the Eclipse workspace, locate the **org.eclipse.kura.emulator**
project. Expand it to show the src/main/resources folder.

Right-click the **Kura_Emulator.launch** file. In the context
menu, select the **Run as** option, and select the
**Kura_Emulator***. This will start Kura running locally and
will display a Console window in the bottom pane in Eclipse. The Console
window will show the OSGi diagnostics as various bundles start and
execute.

Because the **org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi** bundle is in the
workspace with a valid activate() method, it is automatically started
with the Kura OSGi framework. Note the INFO message highlighted below
that shows the bundle’s activate() method was run.

#### List OSGi Bundles in Local Mode

With the OSGi framework running in the Eclipse console (refer to the
previous section), click in the Console window. Press **Enter/Return**
and then type the ‘**ss**’ command to show a list of installed bundles.
Note the bundle ID number for the
**org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi** bundle.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image2.png)

#### Start/Stop Bundle in Local Mode

In the OSGi Console window in Eclipse, run the

    start ##

or

    stop ##

commands to start or stop a bundle, where the “*\#\#*”
is either the bundle ID number or the bundle name (such as “start
org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi”). Note that the INFO messages for
both the activate() and deactivate() messages appear in the Console
window when the bundle is started or stopped.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image3.png)

#### Install/Uninstall Bundle in Local Mode

In the OSGi Console window in Eclipse, bundles can be installed or
uninstalled. To uninstall the example bundle, issue the command
‘**uninstall *\#\#***’, where “*\#\#*” is either the bundle ID number or
the bundle name, such as:

	uninstall 47

or

	uninstall org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi

A message will appear indicating that the bundle has been stopped.

Once the bundle has been uninstalled from the local OSGi console, it
cannot be started or installed by number or name. Instead, it must be
installed by using the plug-in JAR file created earlier. Issue the
‘**install**’ command to install a bundle into the Emulation
environment:

	install file:/[*path_to_bundle*]/[*bundle_name*].jar

where *“[path_to_bundle]*/*[bundle_name]*.jar” should be replaced
with the name of the bundle exported earlier (the section [Hello World
Using the Kura Logger](kura-setup.html)), as shown in the example
below:

	install file:/Users/Nina/Documents/myPlugins/plugins/plugins/plugins/plugins/plugins/org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi_ 1.0.0.201409101740.jar

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image4.png)

Then the bundle can be started or stopped, as described in the previous
section, [Start/Stop Bundle in Local
Mode](#startstop-bundle-in-local-mode). Optionally, you can add the flag
**‘-start**’ to the ‘**install**’ command to automatically start the
bundle after installation.

### Remote Target Device

One or more OSGi bundles can be deployed to a remote device running
Kura, either by installing separate bundle files or deployment packages
using Eclipse.

{% include alerts.html message="These steps require Kura to be running on the target device." %}

This method of deployment is temporary on the remote target device and
is not persistent after a restart. To make the deployment permanent, see
[Making Deployment Permanent](#making-deployment-permanent).

#### Connect to Remote OSGi Framework

To deploy a bundle to the remote target device, you will need to connect
Eclipse to the OSGi framework running on the device. This is done using
mToolkit. See [Kura Setup](kura-setup.html) for instructions on
installing mToolkit into the Eclipse development environment.

*  Select the Eclipse menu **Window \| Show View \| Other**.

*  Select **mToolkit -\> Frameworks** entry to open the mToolkit
    Frameworks view.

*  Enter a name for the framework definition and the IP address of the
    target device.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image6.png)

Close the dialog by clicking the **OK** button.

{% include alerts.html message="The remote target device must have port 1450 open in its firewall, in order to allow mToolkit o make a connection to its OSGi framework. If this port is not opened, refer to the section [Open Port for OSGi Remote Connection](#open-port-for-osgi-remote-connection)." %}

Right-click the framework icon name and select **Connect Framework**.
The list of installed bundles and deployment packages should be
retrieved shortly. (Use the **Disconnect Framework** option to
disconnect from the remote target framework when finished.)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image7.png)

#### Open Port for OSGi Remote Connection

In order to allow mToolkit to make a remote connection to the OSGi
framework on the target device, the device must allow the incoming port
in its firewall. To set this option, open a Web browser and log into
Kura using its current IP address, such as:

http://10.11.5.4

Click the **Firewall** icon and then click the **Open Ports** tab. If
port 1450 is not shown in the list of allowed ports, click the **New**
button under Open Ports. Enter the port **1450** and select protocol
**TCP**. Then click **Submit**.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image8.png)

Now, click **Apply** to apply changes to the remote device.<span
id="_Install_Single_Bundle" class="anchor"></span>

#### Install Single Bundle to Target Device

With the Eclipse environment connected to the remote OSGi target
framework, a single bundle can be installed on the remote device.

In the mToolkit Frameworks view, right-click the Framework name and
select **Install Bundle**. (This requires that you have exported the
bundle as a deployable plug-in JAR file. See the section [Hello World
Using the Kura Logger](kura-setup.html).)

Use the **Browse** button to select the JAR file and click **OK** to
install it to the target device.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image9.png)

The newly installed bundle should be shown in the Frameworks view under
Bundles.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image10.png)

To control operation of the bundle through the OSGi Frameworks view,
right-click the bundle name. The following actions can be performed:

*  Start – start the bundle

*  Stop – stop the bundle

*  Update – reinstall the bundle

*  Install Bundle – install a different bundle

*  Uninstall Bundle – remove this bundle from the target device

*  Show Bundle IDs / Show Bundle Versions – show additional information
    about bundles

You can also verify operation of the bundle on the target device itself.
See the section [Manage Bundles on Target
Device](#manage-bundles-on-target-device).

#### Install Deployment Package to Target Device

With the Eclipse environment connected to the remote OSGi target
framework, a deployment package can be installed on the remote device.

NOTE: If you have just installed the individual bundle in the previous
section, you should uninstall it before proceeding. Doing so will avoid
any confusion in having the same bundle installed twice.

In the mToolkit Frameworks view, right-click the Framework name and
select **Install Deployment Package**. (This step requires that you have
exported the bundle as a deployable plug-in JAR file. See the section
[Hello World Using the Kura Logger](hello-example.html) for instructions on
exporting the OSGi bundle.)

Open the resources/dp folder in the Workspace filesystem directory,
select the **.dp** file (**not** the “.dpp” file), and click **OK**.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image11.png)

The deployment package will be installed on the target device and shown
in the Frameworks view under Deployment Packages. (The deployment
package can also be uninstalled from the Framework view.)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image12.png)

The bundle included in the deployment package can also be viewed under
Bundles and can be controlled remotely (start/stop) as with other
bundles. The operation of the bundle can also be verified on the target
device itself. See the section [Manage Bundles on Target
Device](#manage-bundles-on-target-device).

## Connect to OSGi on Target Device

You can manage the OSGi framework on a target device by logging into a
console on the device using a connected keyboard and VGA monitor or over
a network connection using SSH (PuTTY in Windows or ‘**ssh**’ from Linux
or Mac).

At the command prompt, display the Kura log file with:

	tail -f /var/log/kura.log

Connect to the OSGi framework by typing the following
commands:

	telnet localhost 5002

There are many commands available in the OSGi console for managing
bundles. Following are just a few useful commands:

Command       ||
--------------|---|
ss            |Lists names and ID of bundles|
help          |Displays the help menu of OSGi commands|
lb            |Lists all installed bundles and IDs|
h [bundle IDs]|Displays bundle headers (i.e., Bundle Manifest Version, Name, Required Execution Environment, Symbolic Name, Version, Import Package, Manifest Version, and Service Component)|
exit          |Exits the OSGi console and stops Kura|
disconnect    |Exits the OSGi console, but leaves Kura running|


### Manage Bundles on Target Device

From the OSGi command line, you can display a list of bundles with the
‘**ss**’ command as shown in the example below:

	ss

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image13.png)

In this example, the org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi bundle ID is
64.

You can run the ‘**start *\#\#***’ or ‘**stop *\#\#***’ commands to
start or stop a bundle, where the *“\#\#*” is either the bundle ID
number or the bundle name (such as “**start
org.eclipse.kura.example.hello_osgi**”). To verify that the bundled is
stopped, you can issue the ‘**ss**’ command. If the bundled is stopped,
the activity will show RESOLVED (as shown below). If the bundle is
started, the activity will show ACTIVE (as shown above).

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image14.png)

### Set Kura Logger Levels

Kura logger levels are defined in a configuration file. The messages
that appear require a log statement in the application and that the log
level of the statement matches the log level of the application (such as
logger.info or logger.debug).

To set or change logger levels, the Kura logger configuration file may
be modified using the vi editor. From the Linux command prompt, enter
the following command:

	vi /opt/eclipse/kura/kura/log4j.properties

At the bottom of the “log4j.properties” file, there will be one or more
“log4j” logger property entries, which determine the logger level used
by the bundles at startup.

In the example screen capture shown below, the
“log4j.logger.org.eclipse.kura” property has been set to “INFO”, which
applies to all bundles that start with “org.eclipse.kura.” Additional,
more specific, properties may be defined as required for your particular
logging needs. The property entries will take on the defined logger
level at startup. The logger levels are hierarchical, so that those in a
deeper level of the hierarchy will apply; otherwise, the more general
logger level will override them.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/deploying_bundles/media/image15.png)

Once you have made the necessary changes, save and close the file using
the ‘**:wq**’ command. Restart Kura, and check the log levels in the
OSGi console again to make sure that the desired levels have taken
effect.

## Making Deployment Permanent

The mToolkit deployment of a package is a temporary installation and
does not make the package permanent. Once a set of bundles has been
tested on the remote target device and is ready for permanent
deployment, the software can be installed on a device with deployment
packages from the command line of a target device using the instructions
below:

1.  Copy the deployment package file (\*.dp) to the target device, into
    the folder:  
```
/opt/eclipse/kura/kura/packages
```
2.  Edit the dpa.properties file through the vi editor by entering the following command:  
```
  vi /opt/eclipse/kura/kura/dpa.properties
```
3.  Add an entry in the dpa.properties file to include the new package name, such as:  
```
package_name=file\:/opt/eclipse/kura/kura/packages/package_filename.dp
```  
where, “package_name” and “package_filename” should be replaced with the actual name of the deployment package.

4.  Save and close the file using the ‘**:wq**’ command.

5.  Then restart Kura, and the new package should be installed in
    addition to the default Kura package.

In conclusion, this section described how to test a bundle in an
Emulation environment within the Eclipse IDE and how to install bundles
and Deployment Packages to a remote target system running Kura.
