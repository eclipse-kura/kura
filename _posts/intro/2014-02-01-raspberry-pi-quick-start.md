## Overview

This section provides Eclipse Kura&trade; quick installation procedures for the
Raspberry Pi and the Kura development environment.

{% include alerts.html message="This quickstart will install the version of Kura with the administrative web UI and network  configuration support but not CAN support. For more information on this please visit the [Eclipse Kura download page](https://www.eclipse.org/kura/downloads.php)" %}

This quickstart has been tested using the following image:

<pre>2019-07-10-raspbian-buster-lite.img</pre>

downloaded from

<pre>https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/</pre>

and with the NOOBS image installed on the sd card bundled with the Raspberry Pi 3.

## Enable SSH Access

The ssh server is disabled by default on Raspbian images released after November 2016,
in order to enable it to follow the instructions available at the following URL:

<pre>https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/</pre>

## Eclipse Kura&trade; Installation

{% include alerts.html message="The last Raspbian Stretch adopts the new <a href='https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/' target='_blank'>Consistent Network Device Naming</a>. To correctly run Eclipse Kura on the Raspberry Pi, it should be disabled adding the ```net.ifnames=0``` parameter at the end of the /boot/cmdline.txt file." %}

To install Kura with its dependencies on the Raspberry Pi, perform the
following steps:

1. Boot the Raspberry Pi with the latest Raspbian image (starting from release 2.1.0 Kura only supports Debian 8 or above).

2. The dhcpcd5 package is not compatible with Kura and needs to be removed
    performing the following command:

    <pre>sudo apt-get purge dhcpcd5</pre>

3. After removing dhcpcd5 package you need to enable network interface(s) and ensure internet access. Follow the instructions <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/37920/how-do-i-set-up-networking-wifi-static-ip-address/74428#74428" target="_blank">here</a>.

4. Install the gdebi command line tool:

    <pre>sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install gdebi-core</pre>

5. Make sure that Java 8 is installed with

    <pre>java -version</pre>

    if not install OpenJDK 8 performing the following command:

    <pre>sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless</pre>

6. Download the Kura package with:

    <pre>wget http://download.eclipse.org/kura/releases/&lt;version&gt;/kura_&lt;version&gt;_raspberry-pi-2-3_installer.deb</pre>

    Note: replace \<version\> in the URL above with the version number of the latest release (e.g. 4.1.0).

7. Install Kura with: 

    <pre>sudo gdebi kura_&lt;version&gt;_raspberry-pi-2-3_installer.deb</pre>

8. It could happen that 'wlan' interface is "soft blocked" by default and needs to be enabled. To see if it is blocked run:

    <pre>rfkill list</pre>

    and unblock it with:

    <pre>sudo rfkill unblock wlan</pre>

9. Reboot the Raspberry Pi with:

    <pre>sudo reboot</pre>

    Kura starts on the target platform after reboot.

10. Kura setups a local web ui that is available using a browser via:

     <pre>https://&lt;device-ip&gt;</pre>

     The browser will prompt the user to accept the connection to an endpoint with an untrusted certificate:
     ![Untrusted certificate page]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/admin/untrusted_cert1.png)

     ![Untrusted certificate details]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/admin/untrusted_cert2.png)

     ![Proceed trusting the source]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/admin/untrusted_cert3.png)

     Once trusted the source, the user will be redirected to a login page where the default **username** is:

     <pre>admin</pre>

     and the default **password** is:

     <pre>admin</pre>

## Development Environment Installation

### User Workspace

To set up the development environment for Eclipse Kura, perform the
following steps:

1. Download and install JDK SE 8 as appropriate for your OS (if it is not already installed). For Windows and Linux users, the JDK can be
downloaded from Java SE 8 Downloads. Use the latest version of Java SE Development Kit.
2. Download and install the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers from the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse download site</a>.
3.  Download the Kura user workspace archive from the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/kura/downloads.php" target="_blank">Eclipse Kura download site</a>.
4.  Import the Kura workspace zip file into the new Eclipse project development environment.
5.  Begin developing Kura-based applications for your target platform.

### Oomph Installer

1. Start the Eclipse Installer
1. Switch to advanced mode (in simple mode you cannot add the custom installer)
1. Select "Eclipse for Committers" and select a JRE 1.8+ -> Next

1. Leave all Bootstrap Tasks selected -> Finish
1. Accept the licenses and unsigned content
1. Wait for the installation to finish, a few additional plugins will be installed
1. At first startup Eclipse IDE will checkout the code and perform a full build
1. A few Working Sets will be prepared
