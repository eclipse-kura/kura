## Overview
This section provides guidelines on how to structure the MQTT topic
namespace for messaging interactions with applications running on IoT
gateway devices.

Interactions may be solicited by a remote server to the gateway using a
request/response messaging model, or unsolicited when the gateway simply
reports messages or events to a remote server based on periodic or
event-driven patterns.

The table below defines some basic terms used in this document:

<table class="table table-striped">
    <colgroup>
        <col width="15%" />
        <col width="85%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
        <tr class="header">
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td markdown="span">**account_name**</td>
            <td markdown="span">Identifies a group of devices and users. It can be seen as partition of the MQTT topic namespace. For example, access control lists can be defined so that users are only given access to the child topics of a given account_name.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td markdown="span">**client_id**</td>
            <td markdown="span">Identifies a single gateway device within an account (typically the MAC address of a gateway’s primary network interface). The **client_id** maps to the Client Identifier (Client ID) as defined in the MQTT specifications.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td markdown="span">**app_id**</td>
            <td markdown="span">Identifies an application running on the gateway device. To support multiple versions of the application, it is recommended that a version number be assigned with the **app_id** (e.g., “CONF-V1”, “CONF-V2”, etc.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td markdown="span">**resource_id**</td>
            <td markdown="span">Identifies a resource(s) that is owned and managed by a particular application. Management of resources (e.g., sensors, actuators, local files, or configuration options) includes listing them, reading the latest value, or updating them to a new value. A **resource_id** may be a hierarchical topic, where, for example, “sensors/temp” may identify a temperature sensor and “sensor/hum” a humidity sensor.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

A gateway, as identified by a specific **client_id** and belonging to a
particular **account_name**, may have one or more applications running
on it (e.g., “app_id1”, “app_id2”, etc.). Each application can manage
one or more resources identified by a distinct **resource_id**(s).

Based on this criterion, an IoT application running on an IoT gateway
may be viewed in terms of the resources it owns and manages as well as
the unsolicited events it reports.

## MQTT Request/Response Conversations

Solicited interactions require a request/response message pattern to be
established over MQTT. To initiate a solicited conversation, a remote
server first sends a request message to a given application running on a
specific device and then waits for a response.

To ensure the delivery of request messages, applications that support
request/response conversations via MQTT should subscribe to the
following topic on startup:

**$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/#**

The **$EDC** prefix is used to mark topics that are used as *control
topics* for remote management. This prefix distinguishes control topics
from data topics that are used in unsolicited reports and marks the
associated messages as transient (not to be stored in the historical
data archive, if present).

{% include note.html message="While <b>$EDC</b> will be used for reference for this document, this value is configurable through the CloudService topic.control-prefix variable." %}

A requester (i.e., the remote server) initiates a request/response
conversation through the following events:

1.  Generating a conversation identifier known as a **request.id**
    (e.g., by concatenating a random number to a timestamp)

2.  Subscribing to the topic where the response message will be
    published, where **requester.client.id** is the client ID of the
    requester, such as: </br>
**$EDC/account_name/requester.client.id/app_id/REPLY/request.id**

3.  Sending the request message to the appropriate application-specific
    topic with the following fields in the payload:
    *  **request.id** (identifier used to match a response with a
        request)
    *  **requester.client.id** (client ID of the requester)

The application receives the request, processes it, and responds on a
REPLY topic structured as:

**$EDC/account_name/requester.client.id/app_id/REPLY/request.id**

{% include note.html message="While this recommendation does not mandate the format of the message payload, which is application-specific, it is important that the <b>request.id</b> and <b>requester.client.id</b> fields are included in the payload. Eclipse Kura leverages an MQTT payload encoded through Google Protocol Buffers. Eclipse Kura includes the request.id and the requester.client.id as two named metrics of the Request messages. The Eclipse Kura payload definition can be found <a href='https://github.com/eclipse/kura/blob/develop/kura/org.eclipse.kura.core.cloud/src/main/protobuf/kurapayload.proto'>here</a>." %}

Once the response for a given request is received, the requester
unsubscribes from the REPLY topic.

### MQTT Request/Response Example

The following sample request/response conversation shows the device
configuration being provided for an application:

```java
account_name: guest
device client_id: F0:DE:F1:C4:53:DB
app_id: CONF-V1
Remote Service Requester client_id: 00:E0:C7:01:02:03
```

The remote server publishes a request message similar to the following:

*  Request Topic:
    *  **$EDC/guest/F0:DE:F1:C4:53:DB/CONF-V1/GET/configurations**
*  Request Payload:
    *  **request.id: 1363603920892-8078887174204257595**
    *  **requester.client.id: 00:E0:C7:01:02:03**

The gateway device replies with a response message similar to the
following:

*  Response Topic:
    *  **$EDC/guest/00:E0:C7:01:02:03/CONF-V1/REPLY/1363603920892-8078887174204257595**
*  Response Payload, where the following properties are mandatory:
    *  **response.code** </br>Possible response code values include:
      *  **200 (RESPONSE_CODE_OK)**
      *  **400 (RESPONSE_CODE_BAD_REQUEST)**
      *  **404 (RESPONSE_CODE_NOTFOUND)**
      *  **500 (RESPONSE_CODE_ERROR)**
    *  **response.exception.message** (value is null or an exception
    message)
    *  **response.exception.message** (value is null or an exception stack
    trace)

{% include note.html message="In addition to the mandatory properties, the response payload may also have custom properties whose description is beyond the scope of this document." %}

It is recommended that the requester server employs a timeout to control the length of time that it waits for a response from
the gateway device. If a response is not received within the timeout
interval, the server can expect that either the device or the
application is offline.

## MQTT Remote Resource Management

A remote server interacts with the application’s resources through
*read*, *create* and *update*, *delete,* and *execute* operations. These
operations are based on the previously described request/response
conversations.

### Read Resources

An MQTT message published on the following topic is a read request for
the resource identified by the **resource_id**:

*  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/GET/resource_id**

The receiving application responds with a REPLY message containing the
latest value of the requested resource.

The **resource_id** is application specific and may be a hierarchical
topic. It is recommended to design resource identifiers following the
best practices established for REST API.

For example, if an application is managing a set of sensors, a read
request issued to the topic
"**$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/GET/sensors**" will reply with
the latest values for all sensors.

Similarly, a read request issued to the topic
"**$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/GET/sensors/temp**" will reply
with the latest value for only a temperature sensor that is being
managed by the application.

### Create or Update Resources

An MQTT message published on the following topic is a create or update
request for the resource identified by the **resource_id**:

*  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/PUT/resource_id**

The receiving application creates the specified resource (or updates it
if it already exists) with the value supplied in the message payload and
responds with a REPLY message.

As in the read operations, the **resource_id** is application specific
and may be a hierarchical topic. It is recommended to design resource
identifiers following the best practices established for REST API. For
example, to set the value for an actuator, a message can be published to
the topic "**$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/PUT/actuator/1**"
with the new value supplied in the message payload.

### Delete Resources

An MQTT message published on the following topic is a delete request for
the resource identified by the **resource_id**:

*  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/DEL/resource_id**

The receiving application deletes the specified resource, if it exists,
and responds with a REPLY message.

### Execute Resources


An MQTT message published on the following topic is an execute request
for the resource identified by the **resource_id**:

*  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/EXEC/resource_id**

The receiving application executes the specified resource, if it exists,
and responds with a REPLY message. The semantics of the execute
operation is application specific.

### Other Operations

The IOT application may respond to certain commands, such as taking a
snapshot of its configuration or executing an OS-level command. The
following topic namespace is recommended for command operations:

*  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/app_id/EXEC/command_name**

An MQTT message published with this topic triggers the execution of the
associated command. The EXEC message may contain properties in the MQTT
payload that can be used to parameterize the command execution.

## MQTT Unsolicited Events

IOT applications have the ability to send unsolicited messages to a
remote server using events to periodically report data readings from
their resources, or to report special events and observed conditions.

{% include note.html message="It is recommended to *not* use MQTT control topics for unsolicited events, and subsequently, to avoid the $EDC topic prefix." %}

Event MQTT topics generally follow the pattern shown below to report
unsolicited data observations for a given resource:

*  **account_name/client_id/app_id/resource_id**

## Discoverability

The MQTT namespace guidelines in this document do not address remote
discoverability of a given device’s applications and its resources. The
described interaction pattern can be easily adopted to define an
application whose only responsibility is reporting the device profile in
terms of installed applications and available resources.

## Remote OSGi Management via MQTT

The concepts previously described have been applied to develop a
solution that allows for the remote management of certain aspects of an
OSGi container through the MQTT protocol, including:

*  Remote deployment of application bundles

*  Remote start and stop of services

*  Remote read and update of service configurations

The following sections describe the MQTT topic namespaces and the
application payloads used to achieve the remote management of an OSGi
container via MQTT.

{% include note.html message="For the scope of this document, some aspects concerning the encoding and compressing of the payload are not included." %}

The applicability of the remote management solution, as inspired by the
OSGi component model, can be extended beyond OSGi as the contract with
the managing server based on MQTT topics and XML payloads.

### Remote OSGi ConfigurationAdmin Interactions via MQTT

An application bundle is installed in the gateway to allow for remote
management of the configuration properties of the services running in
the OSGi container.

For information about the OSGi Configuration Admin Service and the OSGi
Meta Type Service, please refer to the [OSGi Service Platform Service
Compendium 4.3
Specifications](http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage).

The **app_id** for the remote configuration service of an MQTT
application is “**CONF-V1**”. The resources it manages are the
configuration properties of the OSGi services. Service configurations
are represented in XML format.

The following service configuration XML message is an example of a
WatchDog service:

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<ns2:configuration xmlns:ns2=<http://eurotech.com/esf/2.0
  xmlns=<http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/metatype/v1.2.0>
  pid="org.eclipse.kura.watchdog.WatchdogService">

  <OCD id="org.eclipse.kura.watchdog.WatchdogService"
    name="WatchdogService"
    description="WatchdogService Configuration">

  <Icon resource="WatchdogService"/>

  <AD id="watchdog.timeout"
    name="watchdog.timeout"
    required="true"
    default="10000"
    cardinality="0"
    type="Integer"
    description=""/>
  </OCD>

  <ns2:properties>
    <ns2:property type="Integer" array="false" name="watchdog.timeout">
      <ns2:value>10000</ns2:value>
    </ns2:property>
  </ns2:properties>
</ns2:configuration>
```

The service configuration XML message is comprised of the following
parts:

*  The **Object Class Definition** (OCD), which describes the service
    attributes that may be configured. (The syntax of the OCD element is
    described in the [OSGi Service Platform Service Compendium 4.3
    Specifications](http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage),
    Section 105.3.)

*  The **properties** element, which contains one or more properties
    with their associated type and values. The type name must match the
    name provided in the corresponding attribute definition identifier
    (AD id) contained in the OCD.

The “CONF-V1” application supports the read and update resource
operations as described in the following sections.<span
id="_Read_All_Configurations" class="anchor"></span>

#### Read All Configurations

This operation provides all service configurations for which remote
administration is supported.

*  Request Topic:
    *  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/CONF-V1/GET/configurations**
*  Request Payload:
    *  Nothing application-specific beyond the request ID and requester
        client ID
*  Response Payload:
    *  Configurations of all the registered services serialized in XML
        format

#### Read Configuration for a Given Service

This operation provides configurations for a specific service that is
identified by an OSGi service persistent identifier (**pid)**.

*  Request Topic:
    *  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/CONF-V1/GET/configurations/pid**
*  Request Payload:
    *  Nothing application-specific beyond the request ID and requester
        client ID
*  Response Payload:
    *  Configurations of the registered service identified by a **pid**
        serialized in XML format

#### Update All Configurations

This operation remotely updates the configuration of a set of services.

*  Request Topic:
    *  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/CONF-V1/PUT/configurations**
*  Request Payload:
    *  Service configurations serialized in XML format
*  Response Payload:
    *  Nothing application-specific beyond the response code

#### Update the Configuration of a Given Service

This operation remotely updates the configuration of the service
identified by a **pid**.

*  Request Topic:
    *  **$EDC/account_name/client_id/CONF-V1/PUT/configurations/pid**
*  Request Payload:
    *  Service configurations serialized in XML format
*  Response Payload:
    *  Nothing application-specific

#### Example Management Web Application

The previously described read and update resource operations can be
leveraged to develop a web application that allows for remote OSGi
service configuration updates via MQTT though a web user-interface.

The screen capture that follows shows an example administration
application where, for a given IOT gateway, a list of all configurable
services are presented to the administrator.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mqtt_namespace/media/image1.png)

When one such service is selected, a form is dynamically generated based on the
metadata provided in the service OCD. This form includes logic to handle
different attribute types, validate acceptable value ranges, and render
optional values as drop-downs. When the form is submitted, the new
values are communicated to the device through an MQTT resource update
message.

### Remote OSGi DeploymentAdmin Interactions via MQTT

An application is installed in the gateway to allow for the remote
management of the deployment packages installed in the OSGi container.

For information about the OSGi Deployment Admin Service, please refer to
the [OSGi Service Platform Service Compendium 4.3
Specifications](http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage).

The **app_id** for the remote deployment service of an MQTT application
is “**DEPLOY-V1**”. The resources it manages are the packages deployed
in the OSGi container. Deployment packages are represented in XML
format.

The following XML message is an example of a service deployment:

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

<packages>
  <package>
    <name>esf</name>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <bundles>
      <bundle>
        <name>org.hsqldb.hsqldb</name>

  </package>
</packages>
```

The deployment package XML message is comprised of the following package
elements:

*  Symbolic name
*  Version
*  Bundles that are managed by the deployment package along with their
    symbolic name and version

#### Example Management Web Application

The previously described read, start/stop, and install/uninstall
resource operations can be leveraged to develop a web application that
allows for remote package deployment via MQTT through a web
user-interface.

The screen capture that follows shows an example administration
application where, for a given IOT gateway, a list of all deployed
packages is presented to the administrator. It also provides the ability
to install/uninstall or update the packages.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mqtt_namespace/media/image2.png)

The **Bundles** tab lists all installed bundles and provides the ability
to start and stop them as shown in the screen capture that follows.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mqtt_namespace/media/image3.png)


#### DEPLOY-V2
Kura 1.4.0 introduces a new version of the DEPLOY application named "DEPLOY-V2".
The main feature introduced is related to a different approach for package
distribution: instead of receiving the package inside an MQTT message, the device
receives only a download request with all the information needed to perform an
independent download via HTTP.
The "DEPLOY-V2" application continues to support the *read*, *start/stop*, and
*install/uninstall* resource operations.

##### Download Messages

Request:

*  Request Topic:
    *  **$EDC/[account_name]/[client_id]/DEPLOY-V2/EXEC/download**

_Unsolicited messages for download progress:_

The client will start downloading the DP and will compute the size of the
transfer from the HTTP header. This size will be used to estimate the download
progress using the request parameter dp.download.block.size.
Next, the client will report the download progress to the platform by
publishing, with QoS==2, one or more unsolicited messages. If HTTP header is
not available, the device will report 50% as dp.download.progress for all the
download processes.
The value of requester.client.id is one of the last downloads or install
request received.

_Unsolicited messages for install progress:_

If the value of **dp.install** in the original download request is true the client will start installing the DP.
Due to the limitations of the OSGi DeploymentAdmin, it's not possible to have feedback on the install progress.
However, these operations should normally complete in a few seconds, even for an upgrade.
Otherwise (dp.install==false), the platform can request the installation of an already downloaded package through the following message:

            The estimated progress of the install in percentage (0-100%). Due
            to limitations of the OSGi DeploymentAdmin, it's not possible to
            have a linear progress. It will go from 0% to 100% in one step. Do
            not rely on this indicator to detect the download completion.
        *  **dp.install.status** (String).
