This tutorial will present how to use DB Store and DB Filter components in Kura Wires using the OPC/UA simulated server already used in [OPC/UA application in Kura Wires](kura-wires-opcua.html).

The DB Store component allows the wire graphs to interact with the database installed by Kura. It stores in a user-defined table all the envelops received by the component. The component can be configured as follows:

* table.name : the name of the table to be created.
* maximum.table.size : the size of the table.
* cleanup.records.keep : the number of records in the table to keep while performing a cleanup operation.
* DbService Target Filter : the database instance to be used.

The DB Filter component, instead, can run a custom SQL query on the Kura database. It can be configured as follows:

* sql.view : SQL to be executed to build a view.
* cache.expiration.interval : cache validity in seconds. When the cache expires, it will cause a new read in the database.
* DbService Target Filter : the database instance to be used.
* emit.empty.result : defines if the envelope should be emitted even if the query return an empty result.

The following procedure will create a wire graph that collects data from a simulated OPC/UA server, stores them in a table using the DB Store component and publishes them on the cloud platform. Moreover, the DB Filter is used to read from the database and write data to the OPC/UA server based on the read values.

## Configure OPC/UA server simulator

1. Download the [OPC/UA server simulator](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kura-resources/opcua_demo_server.dp) bundle and install it on Kura. It will create a simulated OPC/UA server that exposes some sensors (light, temperature and water sensor) and some actuators (buzzer, led and fan).
2. On the Kura web interface, select "OPCUA Server demo" under "Services" and set "server.port" to 1234. Click "Apply" button. This will start an OPCUA server on port 1234.

## Configure Kura Wires OPC/UA application

1. Install the OPC/UA driver from the Eclipse Kura Marketplace ([here for Kura 3.X](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/opc-ua-driver-eclipse-kura-3xy) or [here for Kura 4.X](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/opc-ua-driver-eclipse-kura-4xy))
2. On the Kura web interface, add the OPC/UA driver:
  * Under "Services", click the "+" button
  * Select "org.eclipse.kura.driver.opcua", type in a name and click "Apply": a new service will show in the **Drivers and Assets** menu.
  * Configure the new service as follows:
    * endpoint.ip : localhost
    * endpoint.port : 1234
    * server.name : leave blank

{:start="3"}
3. Click on "Wire Graph" under "System"
4. Add a new "Timer" component and configure the interval at which the OPC/UA server will be sampled
5. Add a new "WireAsset" with the previously added OPC/UA driver
6. Configure the new OPC/UA asset, adding new Channels as shown in the following image. Be sure that all channels are set to READ and that the associated "node.id" fields are set to:
  * "fan" for the fan channel;
  * "buzzer" for the buzzer channel;
  * "lightSensor" for the light channel;
  * "temperatureSensor" for the temperature channel;
  * "led" for the led channel;
  * "waterSensor" for the water channel

{:start="7"}
7. Add a new "DB Store" component and configure it as follows:
  * table.name : WR_data
  * maximum.table.size : 10000
  * cleanup.records.keep : 0
  * DbService Target Filter : the DB Service pid to be used
8. Add a new "Publisher" component and configure the chosen cloud platform stack in "cloud.service.pid" option
9. Add "Logger" component
10. Add another instance of "Timer"
11. Add a new "DB Filter" component and configure as follows. The query will get the values from the light sensor and if they are less than 200, the fan is activated.
  * sql.view :
    ```
    SELECT (CASE WHEN "light" < 200 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "led" FROM "WR_data" ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC LIMIT 1;
    ```

  * cache.expiration.interval : 0
  * DbService Target Filter : the DB Service pid to be used
12. Add another "WireAsset" with the OPC/UA driver, configured as shown in the following image. Be sure that all channels are set to WRITE and that the associated "node.id" fields are set to:
  * "fan" for the fan channel;
  * "buzzer" for the buzzer channel;
  * "led" for the led channel

{% include alerts.html message='Be aware that the **sql.view** syntax can vary accordingly to the SQL dialect used by the database. For example, the MySQL dialect doesn\'t allow to surrond the table or columns names with double-quotes. Instead, this is mandatory in the H2DB.' %}

13. Connect the components ad shown in the following image, then click on "Apply" and check on the logs and cloud platform that that data are correctly published.
