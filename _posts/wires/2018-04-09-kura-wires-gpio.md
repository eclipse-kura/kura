title:  "GPIO driver in Kura Wires"
categories: [wires]

In this section a simple but effective example of the GPIO Driver on Wires will be presented. This example will implement a Wire graph that toggles a digital GPIO. A listener will be attached to an input GPIO externally connected to the first one.

Setup a RaspberryPi as shown in [GPIO Driver](../devices/1-gpio-driver.html#drive-a-led-using-the-gpio-driver) section. Add a cable from the LED contact near the red cable to pin 37 (gpio 26) on the RaspberryPi.

## Configure Kura Wires GPIO Driver Application

1. Install the GPIO Driver from the Eclipse Kura Marketplace ([here](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gpio-driver-eclipse-kura-3xy) or [here](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gpio-driver-eclipse-kura-4xy)).
2. On the Kura web interface, instantiate a GPIO Driver:
  * Under "System", select "Drivers and Assets" and click on the "New Driver" button.
  * Select "org.eclipse.kura.driver.gpio" as "Driver Factory", type a name in to "Driver Name" and click "Apply": a new driver will be instantiated and shown up under the "Drivers and Assets" tab.
3. From the "Drivers and Assets" tab, add a new asset bound to the GPIO driver:
  * Click on the "New Asset" button and fill the form with the "Asset Name" and selecting the driver created in step 2. as "Driver Name". Click "Apply" and a new asset will be listed under the GPIO driver.
  * Click on the new asset and configure it, adding only one channel called **LED** as shown in the following picture:

  ![gpio_asset_config]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wires/GPIOAssetLED.png)

  * Click "Apply".

{:start="4"}
4. As in point 3., create a new asset as shown below:

  ![gpio_asset_config_feedback]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wires/GPIOAssetLEDFeedback.png)

  * Click "Apply".

{:start="5"}
5. Click on "Wires" under "System".
6. Add a new "Timer" component and configure the interval at which the LED will be toggled.
7. Add a new "Script Filter" (it can be downloaded from the Eclipse Marketplace ([here](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/wires-script-filter-kura-3xy-0) or [here](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/wires-script-filter-kura-4xy))) and configure it with the following script:

```javascript
// create a persistent counter
counter = typeof(counter) === 'undefined' ? 0 : counter
counter++

// emit the counter value in a different WireRecord
var counterRecord = newWireRecord()
counterRecord.LED = newBooleanValue(counter%2==0)
output.add(counterRecord)
```

{:start="8"}
8. Add the "Asset" created at point 3 and connect the "Timer" to the "Filter" and the latter to the "Asset".
9. Add the "Asset" created at point 4.
10. Add "Logger" component and set **log.verbosity** to "VERBOSE".
11. Connect the latter "Asset" to the "Logger". The resulting Wire Graph should be as below:

    ![gpio_wire_graph]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wires/GPIOWireGraphKura.png)

{:start="12"}
12. Click on "Apply". After a while, the led on the breadboard should start to blink at a rate defined by the "Timer" as shown below:

    ![gpio_led_blinking]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wires/GPIOLedBlinking.gif)

Moreover, the kura.log file should show a long sequencce of messages reporting that the value from the input gpio is changed:
