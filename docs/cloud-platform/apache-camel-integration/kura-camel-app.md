# Apache Camel&trade; as a Kura application

As of 2.1.0 Kura provides a set of different ways to implement an application backed by Camel:

 * Simple XML route configuration
 * Custom XML route configuration
 * Custom Java DSL definition

## Kura cloud endpoint

Kura provides a special "Kura cloud endpoint" which allows to publish or subscribe to the Kura Cloud API. The default component name for this component is `kura-cloud` but it may be overridden in the following use cases.

The default component will only be registered once the default Kura Cloud API is registered with OSGi. This instance is registered with the OSGi property `kura.service.pid=org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService`.

If you want to publish to a different cloud service instance you can either manually register a new instance of this endpoint, or e.g. use a functionality like the Simple XML router provides: also see [selecting a cloud service](#selecting-a-cloud-service).

### Endpoint URI

The URI syntax of the endpoint is (assuming the default component name): `kura-cloud:appid/topic`. Where `appid` is the application ID registered with the Cloud API and `topic` is the topic to use.

The following URI parameters are supported by the endpoint:

| Name            | Type    | Default         | Description                                                                      |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `applicationId` | String  | _From URI path_ | The application ID used with the Cloud API                                       |
| `topic`         | String  | _From URI path_ | The default topic name to publish/subscribe to when no header value is specified |
| `qos`           | Integer | 0               | The QoS value when publishing to MQTT                                            |
| `retain`        | Boolean | false           | The default retain flag when publishing to MQTT                                  |
| `priority`      | Integer | 5               | The default priority value                                                       |
| `control`       | Boolean | false           | Whether to publish/subscribe on the control or data topic hierarchy              |
| `deviceId`      | String  | empty           | The default device ID when publishing/subscribing to control topics              |

The following header fields are supported. If a value is not set when publishing it is taken from the endpoint configuration:

| Name                             | Type    | Description                                                                |
|----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CamelKuraCloudService.topic`    | String  | The name of the topic to publish to or from which the message was received |
| `CamelKuraCloudService.qos`      | Integer | The QoS to use when publishing to MQTT                                     |
| `CamelKuraCloudService.retain`   | Boolean | The value of the retain flag when publishing to MQTT                       |
| `CamelKuraCloudService.control`  | Boolean | Whether to publish/subscribe on the control or data topic hierarchy        |
| `CamelKuraCloudService.deviceId` | String  | The device ID when publishing to control topics                            |

### Cloud to cloud messaging

As already described, header values override the endpoint settings. This allows for a finer grained control with Camel messaging. However this can cause unexpected behavior when two Cloud API endpoints are bridged. Camel can received from a Cloud endpoint but also publish to it. Now it is possible to write Camel routes with exchange messages, receiving from one Cloud API, pushing to another.

```
-------------------             -------------------
| Cloud Service A |    <--->    | Cloud Service B |
-------------------             -------------------
```

Which could result in a Camel route XML like:

```xml
<route id="bridgeLocalToRemote">
  <from uri="local-cloud:sensor/sensor1" />
  <to   uri="upstream-cloud:gateway1/all-sensors" />
</route>
```

However the Consumer (from) would set the topic header value with the topic name it received the message
from. And the Producer (to) would get its topic from the URI overriden by that header value.

In order to fix this behavior the header field has to be cleared before publishing:

```xml
<route id="bridgeLocalToRemote">
  <from uri="local-cloud:sensor/sensor1" />
  <removeHeaders pattern="CamelKuraCloudService.topic"/>
  <to   uri="upstream-cloud:gateway1/all-sensors" />
</route>
```

## Simple XML routes

Eclipse Kura 2.1.0 introduces a new "out-of-the-box" component which allows to configure a set of XML based routes. The component is called "Camel XML router" and can be configured with a simple set of XML routes.

The following example logs all messages received on the topic `foo/bar` to a logger named `MESSAGE_FROM_CLOUD`:

```xml
<routes xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route id="cloudConsumer">
    <from uri="kura-cloud:foo/bar"/>
    <to uri="log:MESSAGE_FROM_CLOUD"/>
  </route>
</routes>
```

But it is also possible to generate data and push to upstream to the cloud service:

```xml
<route id="route1">
  <from uri="timer:foo"/>
  <setBody>
    <method ref="payloadFactory" method="create('random',${random(10)})"/>
  </setBody>
  <bean ref="payloadFactory" method="append('foo','bar')"/>
  <to uri="stream:out"/>
  <to uri="kura-cloud:myapp/test"/>
</route>
```

This example to run a timer named "foo" every second. It uses the "Payload Factory" bean, which is pre-registered, to create a new payload structure and then append a second element to it.

The output is first sent to a logger and then to the cloud source.

### Defining dependencies on components

It is possible to use the Web UI to define a list of Camel components which must be present in order for this configuration to work. For example if the routes make use of the "milo-server" adapter for providing OPC UA support then "milo-server" can be added and the setup will wait for this component to be registered with OSGi before the Camel context gets started.

The field contains a list of comma separated component names: e.g. `milo-server, timer, log`

### Selecting a cloud service

It is also possible to define a map of cloud services which will be available for upstream connectivity. This makes use of Kura's "multi cloud client" feature. CloudService instances will get mapped from either a Kura Service PID (`kura.service.pid`, as shown in the Web UI) or a full OSGi filter. The string is a comma seperated, `key=value` string, where the key is the name of the Camel cloud the instance will be registered as and the value is the Kura service PID or the OSGi filter string.

For example: `cloud=org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService, cloud-2=foobar`

## Custom Camel routers

If a standard XML route configuration is not enough then it is possible to use XML routes in combination with a custom OSGi bundle or a Java DSL based Camel approach. For this to work a Kura development setup is required, please see [Getting started](../../java-application-development/development-environment-setup.md) for more information.

The implementation of such Camel components follow the standard Kura guides for developing components, like, for example, the `ConfigurableComponent` pattern. This section only describes the Camel specifics.

Of course it is also possible to follow a very simple approach and directly use the Camel OSGi functionalities like `org.apache.camel.core.osgi.OsgiDefaultCamelContext`.

!!! note
    Kura currently doesn't support the OSGi Blueprint approach

Kura support for Camel is split up in two layers. There is a more basic support, which helps in running a raw Camel router. This is `CamelRunner` which is located in the package `org.eclipse.kura.camel.router`. And then there are a few abstract basic components in the package `org.eclipse.kura.camel.component` which help in creating Kura components based on Camel.

## Camel components

The base classes in `org.eclipse.kura.camel.component` are intended to help creating new OSGi DS components base on Camel.

### XML based component

For an XML based approach which can be configured through the Kura `ConfigurationService` the base class `AbstractXmlCamelComponent` can be used. The constructor expectes the name of a property which will contain the Camel XML router information when it gets configured through the configuration service. It will automatically parse and apply the Camel routes.

The method `void beforeStart(CamelContext camelContext)` may be used in order to configure the Camel context before it gets started.

Every time the routes get updated using the `modified(Map<String, Object>)` method, the route XML will be re-parsed and routes will be added, removed or updated according to the new XML.

### Java DSL based component

In order to create a Java DSL based router setup the base class `AbstractJavaCamelComponent` may be used, which implements and `RouteBuilder` class, a simple setup might look like:

```java
import org.eclipse.kura.camel.component.AbstractJavaCamelComponent;

class MyRouter extends AbstractJavaCamelComponent {
   public void configure() throws Exception {
      from("direct:test")
         .to("mock:test");
   }
}
```

### Using the CamelRunner

The `CamelRunner` class is not derived from any OSGi or Kura base class and can be used in scenarios where more flexibility is required. It allows to define a set of pre-requisites for the Camel context. It is for example possible to define a dependency on a Kura cloud service instance and a Camel component provider. Once the runner is started it will listen for OSGi services resolving those dependencies and then starting up the Camel context. The following example shows how to set up a Camel context using the `CamelRunner`:

```java
// create a new camel Builder

Builder builder = new CamelRunner.Builder();

// add service dependency

builder.cloudService("kura.service.pid", "my.cloud.service.pid");

// add Camel component dependency to 'milo-server'

builder.requireComponent("milo-server");

CamelRunner runner = builder.build();

// set routes

runner.setRoutes ( new RouteBuilder() {
  public void configure() throws Exception {
    from("direct:test")
      .to("mock:test");
  }
} );

// set routes

runner.start ();
```

It is also possible to later update routes with a call to `setRoutes`:

```java
// maybe update routes at a later time

runner.setRoutes ( /* different routes */ );
```

## Examples

The following examples can help in getting started.

### Kura Camel example publisher

The Camel example publisher (`org.eclipse.kura.example.camel.publisher`) can be used as an reference for starting. The final OSGi bundle can be dropped into a Kura application an be started. It allows to configure dynamically during runtime and is capable of switching CloudService instances dynamically.

### Kura Camel quickstart

The Camel quickstart project (`org.eclipse.kura.example.camel.quickstart`) shows two components, Java and XML based, working together. The bundle can also be dropped into Kura for testing.

### Kura Camel aggregation

The Camel quickstart project (`org.eclipse.kura.example.camel.aggregation`) shows a simple data aggregation pattern with Camel by processing data and publishing the result.
