# Amazon AWS IoT&trade; platform

## Overview

This section provides a guide on connecting an Eclipse Kura&trade; device to the Amazon AWS IoT platform.

## Prerequisites

* In order to connect a device to Amazon AWS IoT Kura version 1.3 or greater is required.
* An Amazon AWS account is also needed.

## Device registration

The first step involves the registration of the new device on AWS, this operation can be done using the AWS Web Console or with the AWS CLI command line tool, in this guide the Web based console will be used.

#### 1. Access the AWS IoT management console.

This can be done by logging in the AWS console and selecting **IoT Core** from the services list, in the **Internet of Things** section.

#### 2. Create a default policy for the device.

This step involves creating a default policy for the new device, skip if an existing policy is already available.

Access the main screen of the console and select **Secure** -> **Policies** from the left side menu and then press the **Create** button, in the top right area of the screen.

Fill the form as follows and then press the **Create** button:

* **Action** -> `iot:Connect, iot:Publish, iot:Subscribe, iot:Receive, iot:UpdateThingShadow, iot:GetThingShadow, iot:DeleteThingShadow`
* **Resource ARN** -> `*`
* **Effect** -> `Allow`

This will create a policy that allows a device to connect to the platform, publish/subscribe on any topic and manage its *thing shadow*.

#### 3. Register a new device.

Devices on the AWS IoT platform are called *things*, in order to register a new thing select **Manage** -> **Things** from the left side menu and then press the **Create** button, in the top right section of the screen. Select **Create a single thing**.

Enter a name for the new device and then press the **Next** button, from now on `kura-gateway` will be used as the device name.

#### 4. Create a new certificate for the device.

The AWS IoT platform uses SSL mutual authentication, for this reason it is necessary to download a public/private key pair for the device and a server certificate. Click on **Create certificate** to quickly generate a new certificate for the new device.

Certificates can be managed later on by clicking on **Secure** -> **Certificates**, in the left part of the console.

#### 5. Download the device SSL keys.

You should see a screen like the following:

Download the 3 files listed in the table and store them in a safe place, they will be needed later, also copy the link to the root CA for AWS IoT in order to be able to retrieve it later from the device.

Press the **Activate** button, and then on **Attach a policy**.

#### 6. Assign the default policy to the device.

Select the desired policy and then click on **Register thing**.

A policy can also be attached to a certificate later on perforiming the following steps:

Enter the device configuration section, by clicking on **Manage** -> **Things** and then clicking on the newly created device. Click on **Security** on the left panel and then click on the certificate entry (it is identified by an hex code), select **Policies** in the left menu, you should see this screen:

Click on **Actions** in the top left section of the page and then click on **Attach policy**, select the default policy previously created and then press the **Attach** button.

## Device configuration

The following steps should be performed on the device, this guide is based on Kura 3.1.0 version and has been tested on a Raspberry PI 3.

#### 7.  Create a Java keystore on the device.

The first step for using the device keys obtained at the previous step is to create a new Java keystore containing the Root Certificate used by the Amazon IoT platform, this can be done executing the following commands on the device:

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/eclipse/kura/security
```
```bash
cd /opt/eclipse/kura/security
```
```bash
curl https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem > /tmp/root-CA.pem
```
```bash
sudo keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias aws -file /tmp/root-CA.pem -keystore cacerts.ks -storepass changeit
```

If the last command reports that the certificate already exist in the system-wide store type `yes` to proceed. The code above will generate a new keystore with `changeit` as password, change it if needed.

#### 8.  Configure the SSL parameters using the Kura Web UI.

1.  Open the Kura Web Console and enter select the **Settings** entry in the left side menu and then click on **SSL Configuration**, you should see this screen:

    ![](images/awsSSLConfig.png)

    Change the **Keystore path** parameter to `/opt/eclipse/kura/security/cacerts.ks` if needed.

    Change the settings in the form to match the screen above, **set Default protocol to TLSv1.2**, enter `changeit` as **Keystore Password** (or the password defined at step 7).

    !!! warning
        Steps from 8.2 to 8.6 will not work on Kura 3.2.0 due to a [known issue](https://github.com/eclipse/kura/issues/2125). On this version, private key and device certificate need to be manually added to the keystore using the command line. If you are running Kura 3.2.0, proceed with step 8.7.

2.  Open the Kura Web Console and enter select the **Settings** entry in the left side menu and then click on **Device SSL Certificate**, you should see this screen:

    ![](images/awsKuraSettings.png)

    Enter `aws-ssl` in the **Storage Alias** field.

3.  The private key needs to be converted to the PKCS8 format, this step can be performed executing the following command on a Linux or OSX based machine:

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key -out outKey.pem -nocrypt
    ```

    where `xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key` is the file containing the private key downloaded at step 4.

4. Paste the contents of the obtained `outKey.pem` in the "Private Key" field.

5. Paste the contents of `xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt` in the **Certificate** field.

    You should see a screen like this

    ![](images/awsKeysConfig.png)

6. Click the **Apply** button to confirm.

7. **Kura 3.2.0 only** - manually import device certificate and private key into keystore.

    On the host machine, open a terminal window in the folder containing the files downloaded at step 5 and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -export -in xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt -inkey xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key -name aws-ssl -out aws-ssl.p12
    ```

    where `xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt` is the original certificate downloaded from AWS and `xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key ` is the private key.

    The command will ask for a password, define a new password.

    Copy the obtained `aws-ssl.p12` file to the device into the `/tmp` folder using scp:

    ```bash
    scp ./aws-ssl.p12 pi@<device-address>:/tmp
    ```

    Replacing `<device-address>` with the hostname or ip address of the device.

    Open a ssh connection to the device and enter the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass changeit -destkeystore /opt/eurotech/esf/security/cacerts.ks -srckeystore /tmp/aws-ssl.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12
    ```

    The command will ask for a password, enter the password defined when creating the `aws-ssl.p12` file.

    Restart Kura to reload the keystore.

#### 9.  Setup a new cloud connection

1. Click on **Cloud Connections** in the left panel, and setup a new cloud connection

2. Click on the **New Connection** button at the top of the page and set the following parameters in the dialog:

    * **Cloud Connection Factory PID** -> `org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService`
    * **Cloud Connection Service PID** -> `org.eclipse.kura.cloud.CloudService-AWS`

    Press the **Create** button to confirm and then select the newly created CloudService instance from the list.

3. Set the broker URL in the **MqttDataTransport-AWS** tab, it can be obtained from the AWS IoT Web Console clicking on the **Settings** entry in the bottom left section of the page, the URL will look like the following:

    ```bash
    a1rm1xxxxxxxxx.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    ```

    The mqtts protocol must be used, the value for the **broker-url** field derived from the URL above is the following:  

    ```bash
    mqtts://a1rm1xxxxxxxxx.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883/
    ```

4. Clear the value of the **username** and **password** fields.

5. Set a value for the **topic.context.account-name** and **client-id**.

    * Assign an arbitrary account name to **topic.context.account-name** (for example `aws-test`), this will be used by the CloudClient instances for building the topic structure.

    * Enter the *thing* name in the **client-id** field (in this example `kura-gateway`).

6. In order for the previously added keys to be used for the SSL connection with the broker enter the **Storage Alias** defined in step 8.2 (e.g `aws-ssl`) as value for the **ssl.certificate.alias** field.

7. The setting **lwt.topic** under **MqttDataTransport-AWS** needs to be updated as well by entering a value not containing the $ character. This is required because of the fact that AWS IoT does not support topic names starting with $ (except for the $aws/ hierarchy).

8. Press the **Apply** button in the top left section to commit the changes to the **MqttDataTransport-AWS**.

9. Enter a name without the $ character for the **topic.control-prefix** setting in the **CloudService-AWS** tab, for example `aws-control`.

10. The Kura CloudService uses some well-known topics to allow remote device management and to report device state information, this features are not supported by default by AWS IoT, the following settings can be applied in the **CloudService-AWS** tab in order to avoid sending unnecessary messages:

    * **republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.gps.lock** -> `false`
    * **republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.modem.detect** -> `false`
    * **enable.default.subscriptions** -> `false`
    * **birth.cert.policy** -> `Disable publishing`

11. Click the **Apply** button to save the changes.

#### 10. Connect to the cloud platform

Make sure the AWS CloudService instance is selected from the list in the top section of the page and click on the **Connect** button, if the connection to AWS IoT platform succeeds the **Status** of the instance will be reported as *Connected*.
