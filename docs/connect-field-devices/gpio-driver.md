# GPIO Driver

The GPIO Driver manages the General Purpose IOs on a gateway using the Driver model. Based on the GPIO Service, the driver can be used in the Wires framework, the Asset model or directly using the Driver itself.

## Features

The GPIO Driver includes the following features:

- support for digital input and output
- support for unsolicited inputs
- the trigger event can be configured directly through the Driver

## Installation

As the other Drivers supported by Eclipse Kura, it is distributed as a deployment package on the Eclipse Marketplace for Kura [3.x](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gpio-driver-eclipse-kura-3xy) and [4.x/5.x](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gpio-driver-eclipse-kura-4xy). It can be installed following the instructions provided [here](/kura/administration/application-management.md).

## Instance creation

A new GPIO Driver instance can be created either by clicking the **New Driver** button in the dedicated **Drivers and Assets** Web UI section or by clicking on the **+** button under **Services**. In both cases, the `org.eclipse.kura.driver.gpio` factory must be selected and a unique name must be provided for the new instance. 
Once instantiated, the GPIO Driver is ready to use and no configuration is needed.

## Channel configuration

The GPIO Driver channel can be configured with the following parameters:

- **enabled**: it allows to enable/disable the channel. If it isn't selected the channel will be ignored.
- **name**: the channel name.
- **type**: the channel type, (`READ`, `WRITE`, or `READ_WRITE`).
- **value.type**: the Java type of the channel value. The value read by the Driver will be converted to the **value.type**. Conversely, in write operations the Driver will accept value of this kind.
- **listen**: when selected, a listener will be attached to this channel. Any event on the channel will be reported using a callback and the value will be emitted.
- **resource.name**: the name of the GPIO resource as reported by the GPIO Service. The `#select resource` selection has no effect on the channel.
- **resource.direction**: the direction of the GPIO. Possible values are `INPUT`and `OUTPUT`. The `#select direction` selection has no effect on the channel.
- **resource.trigger**: the type of event that triggers the listener, if selected. Possible values are:

  - `NONE`: no event will trigger the listener.
  - `RISING_EDGE`, `FALLING_EDGE`, `BOTH_EDGES`: the listeners will be triggered respectively by a low-high transition, a high-low transition or both.
  - `HIGH_LEVEL`,`LOW_LEVEL`, `BOTH_LEVELS`: the listeners will be triggered respectively by the detection of a high, low or both levels. Please note that these options aren't supported by all the devices.

## Drive a LED using the GPIO Driver

In this section a simple example on the GPIO Driver using a RaspberryPi will be presented. Before configuring the Driver, arrange a setup as shown in the following picture, using a breadboard, a led, a 120-ohm resistor and some wires. Connect the yellow wire to a ground pin on the RasperryPi connector (i.e. pin 6) and the red one to pin 40 (a.k.a. gpio21).

From the **Drivers and Assets** tab, create a new GPIO Driver, call it **GPIODriver** and add an Asset as shown in the following picture.

![](images/GPIOAssetConfigKura.png){ style="border-radius: 7px;" }

The asset is configured to manage a gpio, called **LED**, as an output and drives it writing a boolean value. The **LED** channel is attached to the gpio21 on the RaspberryPi. In the **Data** tab, fill the **Value** form with true and press **Apply**: the green led will switch on. Writing a false will switch off the led.
