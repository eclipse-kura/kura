# Position Service

The PositionService provides the geographic position of the gateway if a GPS component is available and enabled.

When this service is enabled and provides a valid geographic position, this position is published in the gateway birth certificate with its location.

The GPS connection parameters must be defined in order to allow the service to receive the GPS frames. The PositionService supports direct access to gps device or the connection to that through gpsd.

For a device that is not connected to a GPS, it is possible to define a _static_ position by entering _latitude,_ _longitude,_ and _altitude._ In this case, the position is returned by the PositionService as if it were an actual GPS position. This may be useful when a gateway is installed in a known place and does not move.

To use this service, select the **PositionService** option located in the **Services** area as shown in the screen capture below.
