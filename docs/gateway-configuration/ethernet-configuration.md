#Â Ethernet Configuration

As described in the Network Configuration section, Ethernet interfaces have four configuration tabs: **IPv4**, **IPv6**, **DHCPv4 & NAT** and **Advanced**. Each Ethernet interface may be configured either as LAN or WAN; it may also be disabled.

If the interface is designated as LAN in the **IPv4** tab and is manually configured, the **DHCPv4 & NAT** tab is enabled to allow DHCP server and/or 'many-to-one' NAT setup; otherwise, the **DHCPv4 & NAT** tab is disabled.  

For more information on **IPv4**, **IPv6** and **DHCPv4 & NAT** settings, please refer to the [Network Configuration](./network-configuration.md) section. For the advanced settings, see the [Advanced Settings](./network-advanced.md) section.
