# Network Failover

For devices configured to use NetworkManager, it is possible to configure multiple WAN interfaces and a basic network failover functionality.

As in the picture below, the Kura UI allows for multiple WAN interfaces to be defined. Each WAN interface can be configured with a **WAN Priority**. WAN Priority is used to determine which interface will be selected for primary WAN. In the case where the primary WAN interface loses connection, then the next highest priority interface is assigned.

Kura uses NetworkManager's implementation to achieve network failover (see [NetworkManager](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001548/reference/yocto/r_network_failover.htm?TocPath=Digi%20Embedded%20Yocto%7CSystem%20development%7CSoftware%20extensions%7C_____3)). **Lower values correspond to higher priority**. Allowed values range from -1 to 2147483647. Value -1 means that the metric is chosen automatically based on the device type (see [NetworkManager DBUS properties](https://developer-old.gnome.org/NetworkManager/unstable/nm-settings-dbus.html)).

To observe changes to the applied configuration, use the following command on your device's shell:

```bash
route -n

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.2.1     0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 eth0
172.16.1.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     600    0        0 wlan0
172.17.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 docker0
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     100    0        0 eth0
```

The `metric` flag will correspond to the set **WAN Priority**.

The default URI used to perform the connectivity check may differ across operating systems. To set a specific URI edit `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf` (reference [NetworkManager](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001548/reference/yocto/r_network_failover.htm?TocPath=Digi%20Embedded%20Yocto%7CSystem%20development%7CSoftware%20extensions%7C_____3)):
