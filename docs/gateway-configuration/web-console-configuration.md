## Web Server Entry Point

This parameter allows to configure the relative path that the user will be redirected to when accessing http(s)://gateway-ip/. Note: this parameter does not change the Kura Web UI relative path, that is always /admin/console.
The default value set is /admin/console

## Session max inactivity interval

The session max inactivity interval in minutes. If no interaction with the Web UI is performed for the value of this parameter in minutes, a new login will be requested.
The default value set is 15 minutes

## Access Banner Enabled

For security reasons, it may be needed to display to the user a banner that describes the intended system use before authenticating.
