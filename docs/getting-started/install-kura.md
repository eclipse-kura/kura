# Install Kura

Kura is provided using a DEB Linux package. Visit the [Kura download page](https://www.eclipse.org/kura/downloads.php) to find the correct installation file for the target system.



## Installer types

Several installers can be found on such page, and they fall into one of the following categories:

1. specific device profiles, like `kura_5.3.0_raspberry-pi-armhf_installer.deb` (identified with the device name in the [downloads](https://www.eclipse.org/kura/downloads.php) page);
2. generic profiles, like `kura-5.3.0_generic-arm32_installer.deb`; and
3. profiles with suffix **nn**, like `kura_5.3.0_raspberry-pi-nn_installer.deb`

Profiles of types (1) and (2) ship a Kura version with networking functionalities. In particular, the installers of kind (1) use **Kura Networking** for leveraging network interface configurations and are made for a specific device.

Installers of type (2) can be installed on targets with [NetworkManager](https://networkmanager.dev); a commonly available tool for managing Linux networking. Kura leverages this tool for networking functionalities. Refer to the [Generic installers](#generic-installers) section for further information.

Installers of type (3) with the suffix `nn` are **No Networking** profiles that do not bundle the Kura Network Manager: all the network configurations need to be done outside of Kura. Functionalities **missing** in **NN profiles** compared to the full Kura profiles:

- Networking interfaces management
- Firewall configuration management
- Network Threat management



## Generic installers

Kura can be installed using the **generic profiles**:

```
kura-<kura-version>_generic-<arch>_installer.deb/rpm
```

where `<arch>` is one of the **supported architectures**: *x86_64*, *arm32*, and *arm64*. A generic Kura profile can work on systems that have available the dependencies listed in the [Kura dependencies](#kura-dependencies) section, and that have **at least one** physical ethernet interface.

### Initial network configuration

During the installation of a generic profile with network management support, the initial network configuration will be generated dynamically using the rules described below:

- The existing wired and wireless Ethernet network interface names are sorted in ascending lexicographic order.
- The first wired Ethernet interface in the list will be configured as follows:
    - **Status**: `Enabled for WAN`
    - **Configure**: `Using DHCP`

- The first wireless LAN interface will be configured as follows:
    - **Status**: `Enabled for LAN`
    - **Configure**: `Manually`
    - **IP address**: `172.16.1.1`
    - **Passphrase**: `testKEYS`
    - **DHCP & NAT**: `enabled`

- All other network interfaces will be disabled.

For example, if the system contains the following interfaces: `wlp2s0`, `wlp3s0`, `enp3s0`, `eno1`, `ens2`; then `eno1` will be enabled for WAN in DHCP client mode, `wlp2s0` will be configured as an AP, and all other network interfaces will be disabled.

!!! warning
    On systems that do not use systemd's predictable interface naming scheme (see [Freedesktop reference](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/)) the primary network interface name might change whenever a re-enumeration is triggered (for example, after a reboot or after plugging in an external network adapter).

    The advice is to install Kura on systems that use a reliable naming convention for network interfaces.

    Systemd consistent network interface naming assigns the name prefix based on the physical location of the device, see [Understanding the Predictable Network Interface Device Names](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-understanding_the_predictable_network_interface_device_names) for further reference.

### Initial firewall configuration

The initial firewall configuration will be as shown in the screenshot below.

Please note that installing a Kura generic profile with network configuration support will replace the current network and firewall configuration with the one shown above.

### Other Kura services

Kura generic profiles do not contain gateway specific customizations, this implies that the values of some configuration parameters may be incorrect and/or missing and must be manually filled after installation. For example the user might want to:

- Configure the other network interfaces, if any.
- Setup additional firewall rules.
- Edit the `/opt/eclipse/kura/framework/jdk.dio.properties` with the correct GPIO mappings. By default this file is empty.

### Kura dependencies

To have all the Kura features working, the following dependencies are required:

- General: `setserial`, `zip`, `gzip`, `unzip`, `procps`, `usbutils`, `socat`, `gawk`, `sed`, `inetutils-telnet`.
- Security: `polkit` or `policykit-1`, `ssh` or `openssh`, `openssl`, `busybox`, `openvpn`.
- Bluetooth: `bluez` or `bluez5`, `bluez-hcidump` or `bluez5-noinst-tools`.
- Time: `ntpdate`, `chrony`, `chronyc`, `cron` or `cronie`.
- Networking: `network-manager` or `networkmanager`, `bind9` or `bind`, `dnsmasq` or `isc-dhcp-server` or (`dhcp-server` and `dhcp-client`), `iw`, `iptables`, `modemmanager`, `hostapd`, `wpa-supplicant`, `ppp`, `iproute2`.
- Logs: `logrotate`.
- Gps: `gpsd`.
- Python: `python3`.
- Java: `openjdk-8-jre-headless` or `temurin-8-jdk` or `openjdk-17-jre-headless` or `temurin-17-jdk`.
- Others: `dos2unix`

### Supported devices

Kura generic has been tested on the following devices and provides full configuration of all the available interfaces and GPIO mappings.
