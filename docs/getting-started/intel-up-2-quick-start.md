# Intel Up² Quick Start

## Overview

This section provides Eclipse Kura&trade; quick installation procedures for the Intel Up² and the Kura development environment.

!!! warning
    This quickstart will install the version of Kura with the administrative web UI and network  configuration support but not [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) support. For more information on this please visit the [Eclipse Kura download page](https://websites.eclipseprojects.io/kura/downloads.php)

This quickstart has been tested using the latest Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Live Server for amd64 architecture flashed on the SD card with [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

A complete guide on how to install Ubuntu on the Intel Up² can be found [here](https://wiki.up-community.org/Ubuntu).

It is important, in order to access the HAT, Bluetooth, Wifi functionality, to follow the relative steps provided in the complete guide. Make sure to assign the right execute permissions to `kurad` user created by the installer as described [here](https://github.com/up-board/up-community/wiki/Ubuntu_20.04#add-groups).

!!! note
    It is highly recommended to install [the custom Intel kernel](https://github.com/up-board/up-community/wiki/Ubuntu_20.04#install-ubuntu-kernel-540-from-ppa-on-ubuntu-2004) provided in the guide.

## Eclipse Kura&trade; Installation

To install Kura with its dependencies on the Intel Up², perform the
following steps:

1. Boot the Intel Up² with the Ubuntu Image 20.04.3.

2. Make sure your device is connected to internet.

3. Upgrade the system:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    ```bash
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

    !!! tip
        **Optional**: Since version 5.3.0 Kura also supports [Eclipse Temurin&trade;](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/) as an alternative JVM. To install it you need to perform these additional steps:

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install -y wget apt-transport-https gnupg
        ```
        ```bash
        sudo wget -O - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -
        ```
        ```bash
        sudo echo "deb https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list
        ```
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        ```
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install temurin-8-jdk
        ```

3. Download the Kura package with:

    ```
    wget http://download.eclipse.org/kura/releases/<version>/kura_<version>_intel-up2-ubuntu-20_installer.deb
    ```

    Note: replace `<version>` in the URL above with the version number of the latest release (e.g. 5.2.0).

6. Install Kura with: 

    ```
    apt-get install./ kura_<version>_intel-up2-ubuntu-20_installer.deb
    ```

7. Set the right Wi-Fi regulatory domain based on your current world region editing the `/etc/default/crda` and adding the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code of your region.
   
8. Reboot the Intel Up² with:

    ```
    sudo reboot
    ```

    Kura starts on the target platform after reboot.

9. Kura setups a local web ui that is available using a browser via:

    ```
    https://<device-ip>
    ```

    The browser will prompt the user to accept the connection to an endpoint with an untrusted certificate:
    
    ![Proceed trusting the source](./images/untrusted_cert.png)

    Once trusted the source, the user will be redirected to a login page where the default **username** is:

    ```
    admin
    ```

    and the default **password** is:

    ```
    admin
    ```
