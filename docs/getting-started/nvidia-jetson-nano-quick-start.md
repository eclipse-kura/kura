following steps:

1. Boot the NVIDIA Jetson Nano&trade; with the latestÂ Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD Card image.

2. Make sure your device is connected to internet. By default, `eth0` lan network interface is configured in DHCP mode.

3. Upgrade the system:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

4. Download the Kura package with:

    ```
    wget http://download.eclipse.org/kura/releases/&lt;version&gt;/kura_&lt;version&gt;_nvidia-jetson-nano_installer.deb
    ```

    Note: replace `<version>` in the URL above with the version number of the latest release (e.g. 5.1.0).

5. Install Kura with:

    ```
    sudo apt install ./kura_<version>_nvidia-jetson-nano_installer.deb
    ```

    All the required dependencies will be downloaded and installed.

6. Reboot the NVIDIA Jetson Nano&trade; with:

    ```
    sudo reboot
    ```

    Kura starts on the target platform after reboot.

7. Kura setups a local web ui that is available using a browser via:

    ```
    https://<device-ip>
    ```

    The browser will prompt the user to accept the connection to an endpoint with an untrusted certificate:

    ![Untrusted certificate page](./images/untrusted_cert1.png)

    ![Untrusted certificate details](./images/untrusted_cert2.png)

    ![Proceed trusting the source](./images/untrusted_cert3.png)

    Once trusted the source, the user will be redirected to a login page where the default **username** is:

    ```
    admin
    ```

    and the default **password** is:

    ```
    admin
    ```
