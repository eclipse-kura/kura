    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    ```bash
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

4. Download the Kura package with:

    ```
    wget http://download.eclipse.org/kura/releases/<version>/kura_<version>_nvidia-jetson-nano_installer.deb
    ```

    Note: replace `<version>` in the URL above with the version number of the latest release (e.g. 5.2.0).

    ```

    All the required dependencies will be downloaded and installed.

6. Reboot the NVIDIA Jetson Nano&trade; with:

    ```

    ```

    Kura starts on the target platform after reboot.

7. Kura setups a local web ui that is available using a browser via:

    https://<device-ip>
    ```

    The browser will prompt the user to accept the connection to an endpoint with an untrusted certificate:

    ![Proceed trusting the source](./images/untrusted_cert.png)

    Once trusted the source, the user will be redirected to a login page where the default **username** is:

    ```
    admin
    ```

    and the default **password** is:

    ```
    admin
    ```
