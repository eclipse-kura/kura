# GPIO Driver Application

In this section a simple but effective example of the GPIO Driver on Wires will be presented. This example will implement a Wire graph that toggles a digital GPIO. A listener will be attached to an input GPIO externally connected to the first one.

Setup a Raspberry Pi as shown in [GPIO Driver](../../connect-field-devices/gpio-driver.md) section. Add a cable from the LED contact near the red cable to pin 37 (gpio 26) on the RaspberryPi.



## Configure Kura Wires GPIO Driver Application

1. Install the GPIO Driver from the [Eclipse Kura Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gpio-driver-eclipse-kura-45).

2. On the Kura web interface, instantiate a GPIO Driver:
    * Under "System", select "Drivers and Assets" and click on the "New Driver" button.
    * Select "org.eclipse.kura.driver.gpio" as "Driver Factory", type a name in to "Driver Name" and click "Apply": a new driver will be instantiated and shown up under the "Drivers and Assets" tab.

3. From the "Drivers and Assets" tab, add a new asset bound to the GPIO driver:
    * Click on the "New Asset" button and fill the form with the "Asset Name" and selecting the driver created in step 2. as "Driver Name". Click "Apply" and a new asset will be listed under the GPIO driver.
    * Click on the new asset and configure it, adding only one channel called **LED** as shown in the following picture:

    ![GPIO Example Led Asset](./images/gpio-example-led-asset.png)

    * Click "Apply".

4. As in point 3., create a new asset as shown below:

    ![GPIO Example Led Feedback Asset](./images/gpio-example-led-feedback-asset.png)

    * Click "Apply".

5. Click on "Wires" under "System".

6. Add a new "Timer" component and configure the interval at which the LED will be toggled.

7. Add a new "Script Filter" (it can be downloaded from the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/wires-script-filter-kura-45) and configure it with the following script:

    ```javascript
    // create a persistent counter
    counter = typeof(counter) === 'undefined' ? 0 : counter
    counter++

    // emit the counter value in a different WireRecord
    var counterRecord = newWireRecord()
    counterRecord.LED = newBooleanValue(counter%2==0)
    output.add(counterRecord)
    ```

8. Add the "Asset" created at point 3 and connect the "Timer" to the "Filter" and the latter to the "Asset".

9. Add the "Asset" created at point 4.

10. Add "Logger" component and set **log.verbosity** to "VERBOSE".

11. Connect the latter "Asset" to the "Logger". The resulting Wire Graph should be as below:

    ![GPIO Example Wire Graph](./images/gpio-example-graph.png)

12. Click on "Apply". After a while, the led on the breadboard should start to blink at a rate defined by the "Timer" as shown below:

    ![GPIO Example Blinking Led](./images/gpio-example-blinking-led.gif)

    Moreover, the kura.log file should show a long sequencce of messages reporting that the value from the input gpio is changed:
