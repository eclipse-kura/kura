# Eclipse KURA QA

Kura QA activities focused on two main areas:
* unit and integration tests that are executed each time the project builds and
* manual tests, most of which are executed in the weeks before releases.

More on the unit and integration tests can be read in [unit testing](unit-testing.html).
More about manual system testing can be read in [system testing](system-testing.html).
