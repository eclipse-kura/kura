# Introduction

## Eclipse&trade; Kura QA

Kura QA activities focused on two main areas:

* unit and integration tests that are executed each time the project builds and
* manual tests, most of which are executed in the weeks before releases.

More on the unit and integration tests can be read in [unit testing](../unit-testing).
More about manual system testing can be read in [system testing](../system-testing).
