Eclipse Kura - 5.1.1   - April 2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
This service release of Eclipse Kura fixes the Container Management support for Inventory-V1 request handler. 
Minor additional fixes in installers to stop unneeded services in the target devices.


Bug Fixes:
  * Corrected wrong container service reference in Inventory code
  * Removed features folder in Kura examples to prevent duplication
  * Removed unnecessary disabling of services upon installation
  * Network related permission cleanup 

Target Environments:
  * Kura is released as pre-compiled binary installers for the following platforms:
    * Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 based on Raspberry Pi OS (32 bits)
    * Raspberry Pi 3/4 based on Ubuntu 20.04 (64 bits)
    * Intel Up Squared board running Ubuntu 20.04
    * Nvidia Jetson Nano board running Ubuntu 18
  * Kura is also available as a pre-built Docker container for Ubi 8 and Alpine  

Breaking Changes:
  * Eclipse Kura v5.1 does not introduce API breakage with previous releases.
  * The H2DB package has been updated from 1.4.199 to 2.1.210 in response to CVEs that affected the 
    dependency. The new package introduces breaking changes (documented in https://github.com/eclipse/kura/pull/3728), 
    both in database persistence format and behaviour, that will make existing persisted databases not usable with the 
    latest version. Manual migration is required as the H2db project does not provide an automated upgrade solution. 
  * In order to better comply with Wi-Fi regulations on frequency usage, you must now configure the regulatory domain 
    and radio mode before accessing Wi-Fi hotspots that use regulated channels.
  * Configuring the PPP interface number for a cellular interface is no longer supported, the PPP interface number is now assigned automatically.
  * The properties that describe the configuration of a cellular interface are now identified by the modem USB port and not by the PPP interface number.

Known Issues :
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano doesn't support the Unprivileged Command Service (see #3598)
  * isc-dhcp-server fails upon first Kura installation on Raspberry Pi Bullseye. This is due to how the isc-dhcp-server installer package is 
    built and run immediately after installation.
  * An update to the sslmanagerservice where the pid of the keystoreservice is updated can lead to an error in the following reconnection. 
    The issue impact is limited, if the dataservice reconnect option is enabled.  
  * The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
    password that is hardcoded and published.
  * Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi 2 has only been tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
  * Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
