Eclipse Kura - 4.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Eclipse Kura 4.0.0, compatible with Java 9 and OSGi R6, introduces a new model that simplifies plugging new cloud connection implementations.
It brings up a restructuring of the networking part to make it more pluggable and expandable, new drivers and supported platforms, as well as 
improvements to usability and bug fixes.
Being a major release, it also includes breaking changes and removes support for code and platforms no longer maintained by the original contributors.


New and Noteworthy:
  * APIs
    * Cloud Connections: New Cloud Connections APIs that simplify the integration of third party cloud providers, simplifying the development of 
      user applications  
    * Alerts: New Alerting model for special type of messages generated from the device
    * New Bluetooth LE APIs to leverage new TinyB features: updated the TinyB library and updated Kura APIs to leverage the new changes provided 
      by the referenced library 
  
  * Features
    * Eclipse IoT WG Cloud Connection: A new Cloud Connection provider that leverages the new Cloud Connections APIs and enables Kura to connect 
      with remote providers that support the new Eclipse IoT WG Namespace. E.g. this provider supports the integration with Eclipse Hono through 
      the MQTT Adapter 
    * Kura Docker container: New Docker Container that wraps in a Centos 7 environment a Kura No Network installation. 
    * Upload of Asset channels from CSV file: In the Asset view, the user can now download and upload channel descriptions as CSV files.

  * Enhancements
  	* Non-blocking assets configuration updates
  	* Wires Graph Blinking rate limit 
  	* Added fix validity, latitude and longitude hemisphere fields to GPS NMEA Position 
  	* Reduced CPU usage by Kura Wires

  * Refactor and Cleanup
    * Modular support of new platforms: Refactoring of framework structure to support, in a pluggable way, different operating systems and 
      service managers (SysV, Systemd)
    * SSL Manager Service: Service refactoring and cleanup. By default, Kura uses for secure communications its own cacerts.ks keystore instead 
      of the one provided by the Java VM. The default installation provides a cacerts.ks keystore that contains only the Eclipse leaf certificate. 
      To connect to a different provider or broker, the user must install the corresponding certificate in the cacerts.ks keystore, for example 
      using the Kura web UI.  
    * New framework folder structure: The framework folder structure has been redesigned to simplify the user interaction.

  * Drivers
    * New drivers available also in the Eclipse Kura Marketplace:
      * iBeacon Scanner
      * Eddystone Scanner
      * Dummy Driver

  * New Hardware Platforms and Distributions
    * Intel UP Square Boards running Ubuntu and CentOS
    * Rockchip Rock960 AARCH 64 running Ubuntu

    * Removed deprecated newWireSupport as causing invocation loop
    * Removed SslManagerServiceOptions class and modified SSLManagerService APIs
    * Modified "verifySignature" method in Certificates APIs to accept, as first argument, KuraApplicationTopic instead of KuraTopic
    * Removed WireService API and references

  * Deprecated APIs
    * KuraTopic
    * CloudCallService
    * CloudClient
    * CloudClientListener
    * Cloudlet
    * CloudletTopic
    * CloudService
    * CloudServiceFactory

Eclipse Kura - 3.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added Features :
  * H2 Databases: This release will see the switch from HSQLDB to H2. This migration will allow
    for a number of performance improvements as well the ability to maintain multiple database instances.
  * REST API for Kura Drivers and Assets: To allow more flexibility, REST endpoints will be
    added to Kura for interacting with the Kura Drivers and Assets instances.
  * Embedded Artemis Broker: The addition of the Apache Artemis Broker will extend Kura's
    messaging functionality.
  * BLE via TinyB: To improve the reliability of BLE, Kura will switch to the TinyB library
    to support BLE via Bluez.
  * Kura Wires Functional Logic: To extend the usability of Kura Wires, this release will
    include Functional Logic Wire Components. This will allow the use of plain JavaScript
    inside a Wire component.
  * Kura Web UI Update: A new UI element will be added for managing and editing Drivers and Assets.
  * S7 Industrial Protocol: A new driver will be added to the Eclipse Marketplace to support S7.
  * BLE/SensorTag: A new driver will be added to the Eclipse Marketplace to support BLE on
    the TI SensorTag.
  * MQTT publish rate improvement: A limit parameter will be added to the MQTT transport service
    to allow throttling of MQTT messages to prevent unnecessary congestion on the MQTT broker.
  * Connection Monitor: A connection monitor will be introduced to the DataService to further
    improve connectivity reliability.
  * RPMs: This release will provide RPM packaging for Fedora based distributions.

Compatibility:
  * Eclipse Kura v3.1.0 does not introduce API breakage with previous releases.
  * This release does introduce a new set of APIs for TinyB for interacting with BLE devices.
    Support for previous BLE APIs will still be present and functional.
  * In Kura v3.1.0 it is possible to instantiate a Driver instance from the Drivers and Assets
    section or from Wire Composer only if the following requirements are met:
      - the Driver implementation class must implement the following interfaces:
        - Driver
        - ConfigurableComponent or SelfConfigurableComponent
      - the Driver must provide a component definition xml file that advertises that
        the interfaces mentioned above are provided and that sets "required" as configuration policy.
    It is advisable to update the deployment packages of non compliant drivers if needed.
    It is still possible to instantiate non compliant drivers using the "+" button under "Services".

Target Environments:
  * Kura is released as pre-compiled binary installers for the following platforms:
    * Raspberry Pi based on Raspbian: Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi B+, Raspberry Pi 2/3
    * BeagleBone Black based on Debian
    * Fedora on ARM (Experimental) 
    * Intel Edison (Experimental)
    * APU Debian (Experimental)
    * ARM_64 Debian (Experimental)

Eclipse Kura - 3.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added Features :
  * Eclipse Kura Wires
    https://github.com/eclipse/kura/wiki/Kura-Wires:-introduction-and-references
  * Eclipse Kura Drivers and Assets APIs and implementations
  * Contributed Eclipse Kura OPC UA driver based on Eclipse Milo
  * Improvements to local Web Console's usability and appearance
  * Added support for MQTT over Websockets
  * Added support for AWS IoT and Azure IoT platforms
  * Simple JSON is now a supported encoding option in Eclipse Kura Cloud Service
  * Introduced official support to Oomph installer
  * Added support for Fedora 25 ARM based systems

Compatibility Changes:
  * Switched to Equinox 3.11.1
  * Added support for Java 8. It is now the minimal JVM requirement to run Eclipse Kura
  * Dropped support for all the native libraries but ARMv6 HF and x86_64 architectures
  * Dropped support for Fedberry 24 systems
  * The configuration service will only track so called "Relevant services" so the ones that, in their component
    description files, will provide the ConfigurableComponent interface. The old behavior can be restored by setting the
    "org.eclipse.kura.core.configuration.legacyServiceTracking" property to true.

Know Issues :
  * Multiple connections: updating a service (e.g. MqttDataTransport) of a connection
    has the effect to cause the unwanted reactivation of the next higher layer service (i.e. DataService)
    of the other connection(s). This in turn will cause the reactivation of all dependent components.
    This is not desired and not yet understood (Equinox bug?). See also Github issue #311.

Eclipse Kura - 1.1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
   * Fixed JVM memory leak by making sure all stream are closed and
     the streams associated to the stdout and stderr of external processes
     are consumed asynchronously
   * Overall optimization of the network related bundles by removing
     unnecessary executions of external processes
   * Fixed MANIFESTs removing unused imports and fixing Import-Package version
     ranges to comply with OSGi Semantic Versioning
   * Ppp0 connection not starting after a fresh install
   * Modem did not recover the connection when the antenna is unplugged
   * Avoid starting two Kura instances
   * Rolling back to snapshot 0 does not change the modem configuration on the Minigateway
   * Don't allow to set the gateway on LAN interfaces
   * When reconfiguring Wifi from Station to Access Point, DHCP&NAT tab gets enabled only
     after clicking on the 'Wireless' tab
   * Since we don't support 802.11a, do not allow this in configuration
   * Poweroff command fails at 'Stopping Kura'
   * Disable snmpd to avoid excessive flash writes on raw-flash devices

Known Issues:
   * The reference JVM is Oracle Java SE Embedded version 7 Update 40.
     Later versions (including Oracle Java SE Embedded version 8 Update 33)
     may be affected by a ProcessBuilder memory leak [1]
   * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
   * Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
     in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
   * When first modem configuration is submitted, unconfigured cellular interface for serial modem (e.g. HE910) is not being replaced by
     ppp0 interface. Both ppp0 and HE910 interfaces are shown in the Web Admin.
   * Gateway needs to be rebooted for static GPS coordinates to be published to the cloud.
