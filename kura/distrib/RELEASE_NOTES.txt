Eclipse Kura - 5.2.1 - November 2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
This service release of Eclipse Kura includes the following changes:
  - Fixed H2 memory leak in case of in-memory database instances
  - The configuration of network interfaces that are not connected to the system is no longer discarded on NetworkConfigurationService update
  - Fixed build of Ubi8-based Docker image

Target Environments:
  * Kura is released as pre-compiled binary installers for the following platforms:
    * Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 based on Raspberry Pi OS (32 bits)
    * Raspberry Pi 3/4 based on Ubuntu 20.04 (64 bits)
    * Intel Up Squared board running Ubuntu 20.04
    * Nvidia Jetson Nano board running Ubuntu 18
  * Kura is also available as a pre-built Docker container for Ubi 8 and Alpine

Breaking Changes:
  * Eclipse Kura 5.2.1 does not introduce API breakage with Eclipse Kura 5.2.0.

Bug Fixes:
  * e801026468 - Prevent discarding of NetworkConfigurationService properties [backport release-5.2.0] (#4231) (github-actions[bot])
  * 9dc28dd39b - failing Ubi8-based Docker image build on maintenance branch (#4209) (Mattia Dal Ben)
  * 6cc5998e7f - [core] Resolved database memory leak [backport release-5.2.0] (#4205) (github-actions[bot])

Known Issues:
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano doesn't support the Unprivileged Command Service (see #3598)
  * isc-dhcp-server fails upon first Kura installation on Raspberry Pi Bullseye. This is due to how the isc-dhcp-server installer package is
    built and run immediately after installation.
  * An update to the sslmanagerservice where the pid of the keystoreservice is updated can lead to an error in the following reconnection.
    The issue impact is limited, if the dataservice reconnect option is enabled.
  * The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
    password that is hardcoded and published.
  * Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi 2 has only been tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
  * Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
