    The only working version of BlueZ is 4.101. The deb package is not available from Raspbian so it
    must be compiled from sources.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi only tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipest.

    Later versions (including Oracle Java SE Embedded version 8 Update 33)
    may be affected by a ProcessBuilder memory leak [1]
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
  * Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
  * When first modem configuration is submitted, unconfigured cellular interface for serial modem (e.g. HE910) is not being replaced by
    ppp0 interface. Both ppp0 and HE910 interfaces are shown in the Web Admin.
  * Gateway needs to be rebooted for static GPS coordinates to be published to the cloud.
