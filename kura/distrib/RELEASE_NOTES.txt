- This service release of Eclipse Kura includes improvements and fixes to the GWT Servlet code.

Target Environments:
 Kura is released as pre-compiled binary installers for the following platforms:
  * Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 based on Raspberry Pi OS (32 bits) (Kura networking)
  * Raspberry Pi 3/4 based on 64 bits OS (Kura networking)
  * Intel Up Squared board running Ubuntu 20.04 (Kura networking)
  * Nvidia Jetson Nano board running Ubuntu 18 (Kura networking)
  * Generic Debian Package for x86_64 (NetworkManager)
  * Generic Debian Package for arm32 (NetworkManager)
  * Generic Debian Package for arm64 (NetworkManager)
 Kura is also available as a pre-built Docker container for Ubi 8 and Alpine

Bug Fixes:
  * e5ef19d594 - GWT servlet review [backport release-5.4.0] (#5191) (nicolatimeus)

Known Issues:
  * The firewall rule applied by the network threat manager that block uncommon TCP MSS values is not applied in the Nvidia Jetson Nano.
  * When the IPv6 network threat manager is disabled, the filtering on TCP fragments is disabled only after a reboot.
  * The republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.modem.detect property in the CloudService configuration is not supported for devices that use NetworkManager. The property value is ignored.
  * When dnsmasq is used as DHCP server, only one file is used to store the leases.
  * When dnsmasq is used as DHCP server, the DHCP List field in the DHCP and NAT tab shows the leases for all the interfaces.
  * The system reboot command cannot be issued even with a privileged user in Debian Bookworm due to an OS issue related to the CAP_SYS_BOOT capability.
  * The Wi-Fi AP scanning may fail in Debian Bookworm on the first scanning attempt in the specific Raspberry PI profile. A forced rescan can succeed and properly display the available APs.
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano installer disables FAN protocol support due to compatibility issues (see #4593)
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano doesn't support the Unprivileged Command Service (see #3598)
  * isc-dhcp-server fails upon first Kura installation on Raspberry Pi Bullseye. This is due to how the isc-dhcp-server installer package is
    built and run immediately after installation.
  * An update to the sslmanagerservice where the pid of the keystoreservice is updated can lead to an error in the following reconnection.
    The issue impact is limited, if the dataservice reconnect option is enabled.
  * The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
    password that is hardcoded and published.
  * Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi 2 has only been tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
  * Only one WAN interface is currently supported with old networking. A warning in displayed
    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
