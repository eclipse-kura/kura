Bug Fixes:
  * 443f471a99 - Fixed unnecessary column type changes in H2DbWireRecordStoreImpl [backport release-5.4.0] (#5158) (github-actions[bot])
  * b0e4b54907 - [linux.usb] memory leak on non-usb udev events [backport release-5.4.0] (#5138) (github-actions[bot])
  * e2123f3559 - [BaseKeystoreService] Add missing key generator provider [backport release-5.4.0] (#5070) (github-actions[bot])

Target Platform Updates:
  * cca825718d - update org.eclipse.kura.linux.usb.version from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1-SNAPSHOT (#5145) (Marcello Rinaldo Martina)

Known Issues:
  * The republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.modem.detect property in the CloudService configuration is not supported for devices that use NetworkManager. The property value is ignored.
  * When dnsmasq is used as DHCP server, only one file is used to store the leases.
  * When dnsmasq is used as DHCP server, the DHCP List field in the DHCP and NAT tab shows the leases for all the interfaces.
  * The system reboot command cannot be issued even with a privileged user in Debian Bookworm due to an OS issue related to the CAP_SYS_BOOT capability.
  * The Wi-Fi AP scanning may fail in Debian Bookworm on the first scanning attempt in the specific Raspberry PI profile. A forced rescan can succeed and properly display the available APs.
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano installer disables FAN protocol support due to compatibility issues (see #4593)
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano doesn't support the Unprivileged Command Service (see #3598)
  * isc-dhcp-server fails upon first Kura installation on Raspberry Pi Bullseye. This is due to how the isc-dhcp-server installer package is
    built and run immediately after installation.
  * An update to the sslmanagerservice where the pid of the keystoreservice is updated can lead to an error in the following reconnection.
    The issue impact is limited, if the dataservice reconnect option is enabled.
  * The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
    password that is hardcoded and published.
  * Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi 2 has only been tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
  * Only one WAN interface is currently supported with old networking. A warning in displayed
    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
