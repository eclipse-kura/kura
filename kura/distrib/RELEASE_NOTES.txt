    * Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 based on Raspberry Pi OS (32 bits)
    * Raspberry Pi 3/4 based on Ubuntu 20.04 (64 bits)
    * Intel Up Squared board running Ubuntu 20.04
    * Nvidia Jetson Nano board running Ubuntu 18
  * Kura is also available as a pre-built Docker container for Ubi 8 and Alpine

Breaking Changes:
  * Eclipse Kura 5.2.2 does not introduce API breakage with Eclipse Kura 5.2.x.

Bug Fixes:
  * 0a4bcfe6e9 - Wires load time [Backport] (#4626) (Matteo Maiero)
  * 1abe40ddc6 - [monitor.dns-server] added check for interface as LAN before starting DNS server [Backport] (#4627) (Matteo Maiero)
  * b360f14801 - Ordering of channels when numbers are bigger than int [backport release-5.2.0] (#4625) (github-actions[bot])
  * 04f8811c16 - ppp pdp context number [backport release-5.2.0] (#4337) (Matteo Maiero)

Known Issues:
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano doesn't support the Unprivileged Command Service (see #3598)
  * isc-dhcp-server fails upon first Kura installation on Raspberry Pi Bullseye. This is due to how the isc-dhcp-server installer package is
    built and run immediately after installation.
  * An update to the sslmanagerservice where the pid of the keystoreservice is updated can lead to an error in the following reconnection.
    The issue impact is limited, if the dataservice reconnect option is enabled.
  * The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
    password that is hardcoded and published.
  * Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi 2 has only been tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
  * Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
