Known Issues:
  * When dnsmasq is used as DHCP server, only one file is used to store the leases.
  * When dnsmasq is used as DHCP server, the DHCP List field in the DHCP[TODO]NAT tab shows the leases for all the interfaces.
  * The system reboot command cannot be issued even with a privileged user in Debian Bookworm due to an OS issue related to the CAP_SYS_BOOT capability.
  * The Wi-Fi AP scanning may fail in Debian Bookworm on the first scanning attempt in the specific Raspberry PI profile. A forced rescan can succeed and properly display the available APs.
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano installer disables FAN protocol support due to compatibility issues (see #4593)
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano doesn't support the Unprivileged Command Service (see #3598)
  * isc-dhcp-server fails upon first Kura installation on Raspberry Pi Bullseye. This is due to how the isc-dhcp-server installer package is
    built and run immediately after installation.
  * An update to the sslmanagerservice where the pid of the keystoreservice is updated can lead to an error in the following reconnection.
    The issue impact is limited, if the dataservice reconnect option is enabled.
  * The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
    password that is hardcoded and published.
  * Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi 2 has only been tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms

    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
