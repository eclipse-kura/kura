#Â This is a bash script that performs the following actions:
#
# 1) Checks if the first and second command line arguments are provided and if they exist in the file system. If any of these conditions are not met, the script prints a usage message and exits with an error code.
#
# 2) If the script is running on a system with the file "/etc/fedora-release", the script creates a file called "ipv6.conf" in the directory "/etc/modules-load.d/", removes any existing lines containing "ipv6" from the "ipv6.conf" file, and appends a new line with "ipv6".
#
# 3) The script removes any commented lines and extracts the non-commented lines containing kernel parameters from the first file, and uses them as patterns to delete matching lines in the second file.
#
# Finally, the script appends the non-commented lines from the first file to the second file.
#
# In summary, the script updates the second file with the kernel parameters specified in the first file and ensures that the "ipv6" kernel module is loaded if the script is running on a Fedora-based system.
