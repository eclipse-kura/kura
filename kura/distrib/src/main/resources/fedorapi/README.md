Manual steps to install Kura 2.1 on Fedora / Raspberry Pi
==

1. Download Fedberry Minimal image from [here](https://github.com/fedberry/fedberry/releases).
1. Copy downloaded image to your sdcard. There are many references on how to do this for your development platform,
such as the [Raspberry Pi installation guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)
      The command for the Fedberry image on Linux or Mac is something like:
      ```
      xzcat ~/Downloads/fedberry/fedberry-minimal-24.1-beta1.raw.xz | sudo dd bs=1m of=/dev/rdisk2
      ```
1. Load the sdcard above and boot the RPi.
1. Scan your network for the RPi (if using DHCP).
      ```
      sudo nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24 | awk '/^Nmap/{ip=$NF}/B8:27:EB/{print ip}'
      ```
1. SSH into the RPi. You will need to be plugged into a wired ethernet network at this point,
but after this step you could configure wifi and repeat the discovery step.
1. Install pre-requisites:
      ```
      dnf -y install unzip psmisc tar telnet bind iptables iptables-services dhcp hostapd dos2unix wireless-tools net-tools usbutils java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless
      ``` 
1. Copy kura_2.1.0_fedorapi_installer.sh to the Fedora machine
1. Run kura_2.1.0_fedorapi_installer.sh as root to install
1. `systemctl start kura`
1. Connect browser to host on standard http port
