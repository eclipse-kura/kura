		description="A component that applies a logical operator to one or two boolean properties received from the first and, optionally, the second input port, emitting the result. For binary operators, the operation is performed when a new envelope is received on a port, using the envelope cached by the other port; alternatively, new envelopes must be received on both ports. For the NOT operator, the operand must be received from the first port.">
