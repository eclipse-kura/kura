/**
 * This annotation denotes that the annotated type is immutable and eventually
 * it becomes thread-safe. By definition, a class is considered to be an
 * immutable class in which the state of its instance cannot be <i>observed</i>
 * to be changed. So, inherently this implies that,
 * <ul>
 * <li>All of its public fields must be declared as {@code final}</li>
 * <li>All of its public final reference fields are either {@code null} or refer
 * to other immutable objects</li>
 * <li>Constructors and methods do not contain references to any potentially
 * mutable internal state.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * In addition, the immutable objects are inherently thread-safe and that is the
 * reason, they can be passed between threads or published without explicit
 * synchronization or locks.
 * @since 1.2
