/**
 * The CloudClient is designed to be used by single application bundles.
 * CloudClient instances are acquired from the CloudService and they
 * are released when the work is completed. Generally, a CloudClient
 * is acquired during the activation phase of a bundle and it is released
 * during the deactivation phase.
 * <br>
 * CloudClient leverages the {@link org.eclipse.kura.data.DataService}
 * for all interactions with the transport layer and the communication
 * with the remote server. CloudClient establishes a set of default
 * subscriptions that allow remote servers or other devices to direct messages
 * to the application instance.
 * <br>
 * If the bundle using the CloudClient relies on custom subscriptions
 * beyond the default ones, it is responsibility of the application to implement
 * the {@link CloudClientListener#onConnectionEstablished()} callback method in the
 * CloudCallbackHandler to restore the subscriptions it needs.
 * <br>
 * The <b>CloudClient.release method will unsubscribe</b> all subscriptions
 * incurred by this client and it will unregister this CloudClient
 * instance from the list of CloudCallbackHandlers registered.
 * <br>
 * There can be more than one instance of CloudClient in the system,
 * ideally one per ApplicationId but this is not enforced.
 * The class accepts more than one callback handler; all registered handlers are invoked
 * when a message is received. It is up to the received to analyze the topic
 * of the message received and handle it appropriately.
 * <br>
 * The CloudClient publishes and receives messages using a topic namespace
 * following a structure as: [CRTL_PREFIX/]accountName/deviceId/appId/appTopic.<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>CRTL_PREFIX: is an optional prefix to denote topic used for control messages
 * as opposed to data messages. The framework makes use of control topics to
 * separate management messages like replies from those used for application data.
 * <li>accountName: an unique identifier that represents a group of devices and users
 * <li>deviceId: an unique identifier within an account that represents a single gateway device.
 * By default, the MAC address of its primary network interface is generally used as the deviceId of the gateway.
 * In the case of an MQTT transport, for example, deviceId maps to the Client Identifier (Client ID).
 * <li>appId: an identifier to denote an application running on the gateway device.
 * We suggest to version the application identifier in order to allow multiple versions of the application
 * to coexist, e.g. CONF-V1, CONF-V2, etc.
 * <li>appTopic topic defined and managed by the application.
 * </ul>
 * accountName, deviceId, and applicationId are derived based on the configuration parameters
 * of the system where this instance is deployed while the applicationTopic is controlled
 * by the application. The following is an example of topic used for publishing where the prefix
 * used for the control Topics is $EDC.
 * <ul>
 * <li>publish: accountName/deviceId/applicationId/appTopic
 * <li>controlPublish: $EDC/accountName/assetId/applicationId/appTopic
 * <li>subscribe: accountName/deviceId/applicationId/appTopic
 * <li>controlSubscribe: $EDC/accountName/deviceId/applicationId/appTopic
 * <li>default subscriptions: $EDC/accountName/deviceId/applicationId/#
 * </ul>
 * Note that the default subscription of a CloudClient allows remote servers
 * or applications running on other devices to publish messages addressed
 * to specific applications running on specific devices.
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @deprecated Please consider using {@link org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.publisher.CloudPublisher} and 
 * {@link org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.subscriber.CloudSubscriber}
