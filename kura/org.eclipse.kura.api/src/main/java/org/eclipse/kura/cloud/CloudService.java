/**
 * The CloudService provides an easy to use API layer for M2M application to communicate with a remote server.
 * It operates as a decorator for the {@link org.eclipse.kura.data.DataService} providing add-on
 * features over the management of the transport layer.
 * In addition to simple publish/subscribe, the Cloud Service API simplifies the implementation of more complex
 * interaction flows like request/response or remote resource management. Cloud Service abstracts the
 * developers from the complexity of the transport protocol and payload format used in the communication.<br>
 * CloudService allows for a single connection to a remote server to be shared across more than one application
 * in the gateway providing the necessary topic partitioning.<br>
 * Its responsibilities can be summarized as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Adds application topic prefixes to allow for a single remote server connection to be shared across applications
 * <li>Define a payload data model and provide default encoding/decoding serializers
 * <li>Publish life-cycle messages when device and applications start and stop
 * </ul>
 * The CloudService can be used through the {@link CloudClient} API or by extending the {@link Cloudlet} class.
 * {@link Cloudlet} simplifies the interactions with remote servers providing a servlet-like API
 * to implement request and response flows and remote resource management.
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *
 * @deprecated Please consider using {@link org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.CloudConnectionManager}
