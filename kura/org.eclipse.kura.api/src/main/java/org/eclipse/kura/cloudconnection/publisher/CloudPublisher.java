/**
 * The CloudPublisher interface is an abstraction on top of the {@link org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.CloudEndpoint}
 * to simplify the publishing process for each application running in the framework.
 * A CloudPublisher is used to publish the specified {@link KuraMessage} to a cloud platform.
 * The CloudPublisher and the associated CloudEndpoint implementations abstract, to the user applications, all the low
 * level specificities like the message destination address, quality of service or properties because those are added by
 * the {@link CloudPublisher} implementation based, for example, on a configuration.
 *
 * When an application wants to publish, it has to take a CloudPublisher instance and use the
 * {@link CloudPublisher#publish(KuraMessage)} method, passing as argument a KuraMessage.
 *
 * Every KuraMessage accepted by the CloudPublisher is associated to a string identifier that can be
 * used to confirm that the KuraMessage has been published.
 * However, the semantics of the confirmation depends on both the implementation and the configuration of the
 * connection.
 * For example, if the protocol of the cloud connection supports message identifiers and acknowledgments, the
 * implementation will map the message identifier to the KuraMessage identifier and confirm it when
 * the message identifier is acknowledged. If the protocol does not support message identifiers, or the message does not
 * request an acknowledge, a confirmed KuraMessage identifier may at most indicate that the message has been
 * successfully transmitted. There is no guarantee that a KuraMessage identifier will ever be confirmed. It is
 * important that the implementation of the CloudPublisher and its configuration match the assumptions of the
 * API consumer about the delivery.
 *
 * For example, if the correct behavior of an application requires guaranteed message delivery, the
 * application should be configured to use a reliable publisher. Of course, applications that do not require this will
 * work with any publisher.
 *
 * @since 2.0
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
