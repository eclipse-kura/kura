/**
 * Interface intended to have a specific implementation associated to a
 * {@link org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.CloudEndpoint} that wraps the
 * specificities related to the targeted cloud provider.
 *
 * The {@link CloudSubscriber} interface is an abstraction on top of the
 * {@link org.eclipse.kura.cloudconnection.CloudEndpoint} to simplify the
 * subscription and notification process, for each application running in the framework.
 *
 * When an application wants to receive a message from the cloud, it has to take a {@link CloudSubscriber} instance and
 * register itself as a {@link CloudSubscriberListener}, in order to be notified when a message is received from the
 * associated cloud stack.
 *
 * In most cases, the consumers are not interested in the header of the received message and assume to always receive
 * the
 * same kind of message. In order to receive different kinds of messages, the consumer should register to multiple
 * subscribers.
 *
 * Some messaging protocols have a hierarchical addressing structure supporting multilevel wildcard subscriptions. For
 * example, an MQTT address (topic) hierarchy might look like
 * building/${building-number}/apartment/${apartment-number}/heating/temperature.
 * To receive the heating temperature measurements for all the buildings and apartments the subscriber can be configured
 * to subscribe to building/+/apartment/+/heating/temperature. When a message is received, the subscriber will notify
 * the application providing the payload received and some properties that are implementation specific, depending on the
 * subscriber, and that can allow the application to understand the corresponding resource.
 *
 * @since 2.0
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
