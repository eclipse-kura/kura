/**
 * The Configuration Service is used to manage the configuration of ConfigurableComponents.
 * It works in concert with the OSGi ConfigurationAdmin and the OSGi MetaTypeService services.
 * What it provides over the native OSGi services is the ability to easily access the current
 * configuration of a ConfigurableComponent together with its full ObjectClassDefintion,
 * the ability to take snapshots of the current configuration of all registered 
 * ConfigurableComponents or rollback to older snapshots and, finally, the ability to access 
 * and manage configurations remotely through the CloudService. 
 * <br>    
 * The Configuration Service operates on a subset of all the Components registered under the OSGi container.
 * It tracks all OSGi Components which implement the {@see ConfigurableComponent} marker interface.
 * When a ConfigurableComponent is registered, the Configuration Service will call its "update"
 * method with the latest saved configuration as returned the ConfigurationAdmin or, if none
 * is available, with the Configuration properties fabricated from the default attribute values as 
 * specified in the ObjectClassDefinition of this service.
 * In OSGi terms, this process in similar to the Auto Configuration Service.
 * <b>The ConfigurationService assumes that Meta Type Information XML resource
 * for a given Declarative Service with name abc" to be stored under OSGI-INF/metatype/abc.xml.</b>
 * This is an extra restriction over the OSGi specification: the Meta Type Information XML resource
 * must be named as the name of the Declarative Service Component. 
 * <br>
 * The ConfigurationService has the ability to create a snapshot for the current configuration
 * of all the registered ConfigurableComponents. The snapshot is saved in the form of an
 * XML file stored under $KuraHome/snapshots/snapshot_epoch.xml where epoch is replaced
 * with the epoch timestamp at the time of the snapshot creation.
 * The ConfigurationService also has the ability to rollback the configuration of the
 * registered components taking them back to a previous stored snapshot. 
 * <br>
 * The ConfigurationService interacts with the CloudService to allow to access 
 * current configuration and to modify it remotely through messages sent and received via cloud.
