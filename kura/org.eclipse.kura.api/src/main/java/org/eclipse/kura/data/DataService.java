/**
 * The DataService provides the ability of connecting to a remote
 * broker, publish messages, subscribe to topics, receive messages on the
 * subscribed topics, and disconnect from the remote message broker.
 * The DataService delegates to the {@link DataTransportService} the implementation
 * of the transport protocol used to interact with the remote server.
 * <br>
 * The DataService offers methods and configuration options to manage the
 * connection to the remote server. For example, it can be configured
 * to auto-connect to the remote server on start-up or it offers
 * methods for applications to directly manage the connection.
 * It also adds the capability of storing published messages in a persistent store
 * and send them over the wire at a later time.
 * The purpose is to relieve service users from implementing their own persistent store.
 * Service users may publish messages independently on the DataService connection status.
 * <br>
 * In order to overcome the potential latencies introduced by buffering messages,
 * the DataService allows to assign a priority level to each published message.
 * Dependently on the store configuration there are certain guarantees that stored
 * messages are not lost due to sudden crashes or power outages.
 * <br>
 * The <a href="http://www.osgi.org/wiki/uploads/Links/whiteboard.pdf">whiteboard pattern</a>
 * is used to notify the service users about events such as message arrived, connection lost etc.
 * through the {@link DataServiceListener}.
 * {@see DataServiceListener}
 * 
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

     * A unique identifier is always returned, independently on the specified
     * QoS or priority level, which can be used to match the asynchronous
     * message confirm.
     *
     * The actual semantics associated to a message confirm is as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>For messages published at QoS = 0, receiving the confirm just means that
     * the message is about to be transmitted on the wire without any guarantee
     * that it eventually will.
     * <li>For messages published at QoS &gt; 0, receiving the confirm means that the
     * broker acknowledged the message.
     * </ul>
     *
     * Priority level 0 (highest) should be used sparingly and reserved for
     * messages that should be sent with the minimum latency.
     * For example Cloud life-cycle messages are published with priority 0
     * as soon the connection is established and just before disconnecting.
     * <br>
     * Data messages, tolerating an higher latency, may be published with a
     * lower priority. Within each priority level and each QoS level, messages
     * are guaranteed do be delivered in order (oldest first).
     * <br>
     * The KuraStoreCapacityReachedException is thrown if the database buffer
     * has reached its capacity for messages that are not yet published or
     * they are still in transit. The limit does not apply to internal messages
     * with the priority less than 2.
     * These priority levels are reserved to the framework which uses it for life-cycle messages
     * - birth and death certificates - and replies to request/response flows.
