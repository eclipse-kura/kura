/**
 * EdcPayload defines the recommended payload structure for the messages sent to the Everyware Cloud platform.
 * Eurotech designed the format as an open format that is flexible from the aspect of data modeling
 * yet is efficient when it comes to bandwidth conservation. The same payload model is used by the REST API 
 * - in which case it is serialized into XML or JSON as requested by the client - or uses the efficient 
 * Google ProtoBuf when sent over an MQTT connection when the bandwidth is very important.  
 * The EdcPayload contains the following fields: sentOn timestamp, an optional set of metrics represented as 
 * name-value pairs, an optional position field to capture a GPS position, and an optional binary body. 
 * <ul>
 * <li>sentOn: it is the timestamp when the data was captured and sent to the Everyware Cloud platform.
 * <li>metrics: a metric is a data structure composed of the name, a value, and the type of the value.
 *     When used with the REST API valid metric types are: string, double, int, float, long, boolean, base64Binary.
 *     Data exposed into the payload metrics can be processed through the real-time rules offered by the 
 *     Everyware Cloud platform or used as query criteria when searching for messages through the messages/searchByMetric API.
 *     Each payload can have zero or more metrics. 
 * <li>position: it is an optional field  used to capture a geo position associated to this payload.
 * <li>body: it is an optional part of the payload that allows additional information to be transmitted in any format determined by the user.  
 * This field will be stored into the platform database, but the Everyware Cloud cannot apply any statistical analysis on it.
 * </ul>
