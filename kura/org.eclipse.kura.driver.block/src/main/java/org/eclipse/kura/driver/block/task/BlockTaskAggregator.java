/**
 * <p>
 * Represents a specialized version of {@link BlockAggregator} that operates on {@link BlockTask} instances.
 * This class performs the aggregation of the input blocks in the same way as {@link BlockAggregator} does, and always
 * returns {@link ToplevelBlockTask} instances as result of the aggregation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If any {@link BlockTask} is found in the input block list, it will be assigned to the proper parent task in the
 * result list, basing on the start and end addresses of the two tasks.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The result of the aggregation performed by this class is therefore a generally two level tree structure: the first
 * level of
 * the tree is composed by {@link ToplevelBlockTask} instances responsible of managing a data buffer, the second level
 * is composed by {@link BlockTask} instances that perform an operation using the buffer of the parent. See
 * {@link ToplevelBlockTask} for more information on this structure.
