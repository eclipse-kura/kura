/**
 * <p>
 * Represent a {@link BlockTask} that has a list of child tasks and maintains a {@link Buffer}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each child task operates on a subset of the interval described by this task and generally use the buffer provided by
 * this class to perform their operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The operation described by a {@link ToplevelBlockTask} generally involves transferring data
 * between a {@link Buffer} and device.
 * The children of a {@link ToplevelBlockTask} generally do not perform actual I/O operations but simply use the buffer
 * managed by an instance of this class by either filling or consuming it depending on the {@link Mode}. In particular:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the {@link Mode} of a {@link ToplevelBlockTask} is {@link Mode#READ} calling the {@link BlockTask#run()}
 * method of this class will trigger the following operations:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The {@link ToplevelBlockTask#processBuffer()} method is called, its implementation must fill the {@link Buffer}
 * of this class with some data, usually obtained performing a read operation from some device.</li>
 * <li>
 * If previous step completes successfully the {@link BlockTask#run()} method of each children will be called. Each
 * child will use the data of the {@link Buffer} filled at previous step to perform its operation (for example
 * extracting some information from it). If the previous step fails the {@link BlockTask#onFailure(Exception)} method of
 * the children will be called to notify the failure.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * </li>
 * <li>If the {@link Mode} of a {@link ToplevelBlockTask} is {@link Mode#WRITE} calling the {@link BlockTask#run()}
 * method of this class will trigger the following operations:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * The {@link BlockTask#run()} method of each children will be called. Each
 * child should fill a portion of the {@link Buffer} of this class.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The {@link ToplevelBlockTask#processBuffer()} method is called, its implementation should use the {@link Buffer}
 * previously filled by the children, for example by transferring it to some device.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If previous step completes successfully the {@link BlockTask#onSuccess()} method of each children will be called. If
 * the previous step fails the {@link BlockTask#onFailure(Exception)} method of
 * the children will be called to notify the failure.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * </li>
