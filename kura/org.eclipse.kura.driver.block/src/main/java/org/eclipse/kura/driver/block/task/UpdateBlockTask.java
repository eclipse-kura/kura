/**
 * <p>
 * This is an helper class that can be used to implement read-update-write operations that involve an same interval of
 * addresses. An example of such operation can
 * be reading a block of data from a device, updating that data and then writing it back.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an instance of this class is provided as input to a {@link UpdateBlockTaskAggregator}, and its {@link Mode} is
 * {@link Mode#UPDATE}, it will be assigned to two parent {@link ToplevelBlockTask} instances by the aggregator.
 * The first {@link ToplevelBlockTask} will provide the data needed by this class for the read part of its operation,
 * and the second {@link ToplevelBlockTask} can be used by this class to write back the modified data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the scenario above, the {@link BlockTask#run()} method of this class will be called twice, the first time for the
 * read part of the operation and the second time for the write. Implementors are not required to implement the
 * {@link BlockTask#run()} method directly but must implement the {@link UpdateBlockTask#runRead()},
 * {@link UpdateBlockTask#runWrite())} and {@link UpdateBlockTask#runUpdate(ToplevelBlockTask, ToplevelBlockTask)}
 * methods instead. See the description of these methods for more information.
