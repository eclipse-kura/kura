/**
 * This static class defines the possible byte organization in
 * the data stream sent and received. The Modbus protocol only
 * defines one analog data type (16 bit) and only one format
 * for that data in the stream (big endian). Manufactures of
 * various "Modbus compatible" field devices have extend and
 * modified the size and arrangementof the data in the stream. Data units may now be 16 or
 * 32 bit sized and may be in a variety of byte arrangements.
 * <p>
 * In the definitions below, the character arrangement making up the definition
 * field value actually represent the ordering of the bytes in the
 * stream. For a hexadecimal number 0x01020304, the '1' is the 0x01
 * byte, '2' is the 0x02 byte, '3' is the 0x03 byte and '4' is the 0x04.
 * <p>
 * The Field values, not the field names should be used in configuration files.
