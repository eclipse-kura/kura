//	Cross Platform Issue:
//	The jni.h header tries to include a file called jni_md.h to get some platform specific type info,
//	the file is different for Linux & Windows and exists in different directories. Since it's only a
//	small file and we know we will be built with mingw create a new jni_md.h in the local directory,
//	get the makefile to include it with -I ".", and define jlong as __int64
